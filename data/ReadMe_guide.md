#### Add new data

The data collection to create the FINS dataset commenced in 2020. We have downloaded all neoselachian occurrences and their associated collections from the Cretaceous and Cenozoic from the PBDB in June 2020. As many publications describing neoselachian fossils were published in the last 5 years, we  provide an option to apply the same data treatment used when creating FINS on new data downloaded from PBDB and to merge this data with FINS to create a more up to date dataset. Please read the following guide before uploading new data. 

### Downloading data from PBDB

Data from many publications published after 2020 were entered into PBDB. If you would like to include data from a publication not in PBDB yet, we recommend first entering it into PBDB and then downloading the data from PBDB. 

Below are the parameters we recommend using when downloading data from the [PBDB](https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displayDownloadGenerator), listed by type of data and by sections:
- **Occurrences**
  - _Select by taxonomy_
    - **Taxon or taxa to include**: neoselachii
  - _Select by time_
    - **Interval or Ma range**: Cretaceous _through_ Cenozoic
  - _Select by metadata_
    - **Occurrences entered after**: 2021
  - _Choose output options_
    - tick **ref attribution**
  
- **Collections**
  - _Select by taxonomy_
    - **Taxon or taxa to include**: neoselachii
  - _Select by time_
    - **Interval or Ma range**: Cretaceous _through_ Cenozoic
  - _Select by metadata_
    - **Collections entered after**: 2021
  - _Choose output options_
    - tick **location**, **geological context**, and **ref attribution**

### _Add data_ tab

A portion of data linked with occurrences are taken from the associated collections, it is therefore necessary that new collections are treated and appended to FINS collections first.
