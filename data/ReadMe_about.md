#### Why FINS?

Modern sharks, rays and skates (Neoselachii) are a diverse, globally distributed, and ecologically important group. 
They possess a rich, geologically extensive, and well-documented fossil record that provides a powerful basis for studying their macroevolution, paleoecology, and biogeography.
However, addressing paleobiological questions require quantifying the fossil record trough occurrences, i.e., records of the presence of a taxon at a unique location in space and time. 
Although the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) offers an invaluable source of fossil occurrences, it still does not provide a complete compilation of neoselachian data. 
The Fossil Neoselachian (FINS) dataset is a comprehensive, systematically curated global synthesis of fossil occurrences spanning the past 145 million years.

#### What are the aims of FINS?

- To synthesise existing knowledge of the neoselachian fossil record
- To provide a standardized, curated and easily accessible compilation of fossil occurrences to facilitate their use in quantitative paleobiology.

#### What data does FINS include?

FINS consists of fossil occurrences, each linked to a collection (location where fossils were reported from) and a source (citation of the publications from which data was obtained). 
All data was subjected to a meticulous curation process, which is described through taxonomic and age validation variables.

**`Occurrences`**<br>
Occurrence data mostly consists of taxonomic variables (e.g., classification, names and ranks), each linked to collections and references

**`Collections`**<br>
Collection data provide geographic (e.g., country, ocean and paleo-coordinates) and geological (e.g., formation and age) variables and are linked to occurrences and references

**`References`**<br>
Reference data consists of the full citation of the publications from which data was obtained.

**`Add data`**<br>
Through this tab you can append additional data downloaded from PBDB to the existing collections and occurrences. Please refer to the "Guide to adding new data" for detailed instructions. 

#### What is the spatial and temporal span of FINS?

FINS spans the entire globe, with fossil occurrences recovered from all continents from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary (145 – 0 Ma), with temporal resolution generally corresponding to geological stages or epochs.
