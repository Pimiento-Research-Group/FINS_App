Here, we present sedimentological and palaeontological data collected by the German-Tanzanian Tendaguru Expedition 2000 in an attempt to reconstruct the palaeo-ecosystems of the Tendaguru Beds at their type locality. Our reconstructions are based on sedimentological data and on a palaeoecological analysis of macroinvertebrates, microvertebrates, plant fossils and microfossils (ostracods, foraminifera, charophytes, palynomorphs). In addition, we included data from previous expeditions, particularly those on the dinosaur assemblages.

The environmental model of the Tendaguru Beds presented herein comprises three broad palaeoenvironmental units in a marginal marine setting: (1) Lagoon-like, shallow marine environments above fair weather wave base and with evidence of tides and storms. These formed behind barriers such as ooid bar and siliciclastic sand bar complexes and were generally subject to minor salinity fluctuations. (2) Extended tidal flats and low-relief coastal plains. These include low-energy, brackish coastal lakes and ponds as well as pools and small fluvial channels of coastal plains in which the large dinosaurs were buried. Since these environments apparently were, at best, poorly vegetated, the main feeding grounds of giant sauropods must have been elsewhere. Presumably, tidal flats and coastal plains were visited by dinosaurs primarily during periods of drought. (3) Vegetated hinterland. Vegetation of this environment can only be inferred indirectly from plant material transported into the other depositional environments. Vegetation was dominated by a diverse conifer flora, which apparently formed part of the food source of large herbivorous sauropods. Evidence from various sources suggests a subtropical to tropical palaeoclimate, characterised by seasonal rainfall alternating with a pronounced dry season during the Late Jurassic. In Early Cretaceous times, sedimentological and palaeontological proxies suggest a climatic shift towards more humid conditions.",Aberhan,"Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe, 5: 19–44",Journal article,English,L,L_2636,"L_3874, L_3875, L_3876",aberhan et al. 2002,Aberhan et al. 2002

Evolution des Squaliformes et paléoécologie.",Universite Montpellier,,"Since two centuries, the fossil record of selachians (Sharks, Skates and Rays) is mainly constituted by fossil shallower fishes of epi-continental seas. The discovery of new selachian faunas from the bathyal marls of the Paleogene of Landes (South-western of France) allows to take into account the real diversity of fossil deepwater communities in comparison with the Recent ones. The systematic study of that inedit material fills the considerable gap in our knowledge of the diversity of fossil deepwater selachians. In addition to numerous unnamed taxa, 31 species and 9 genera have been described for the first time, thus testifying to the great diversity of the order Squaliformes (17 species). A cladistic analysis on dental characters of most squaloid genera has been performed, and has led to propose an evolutionary history of Squaliformes. The latter seems to have been strongly related to major events that occurred in cretaceous seas. In a second part, the observation of the global distribution of Recent selachians showed complex but realrelationships between the faunal structure and geographic or bathymetric parameters. In this context, several paleoecological approaches have been investigated and tested on selachian faunas, as paleobathymetric and paleogeographic indicators. The interests of such studies are obvious for paleoenvironmental reconstitutions and are discussed. ",Adnet,"211 p., 23 fig., annexes, 40 pl. Dipl. Doct., Univ.

fossiliferous sands of Prémontré (Aisne, northern France) but has received little attention. Sharks of the family Triakidae (Carcharhiniformes) are particularly well represented and all are described and figured herein. Among them, two new species of the genus Galeorhinus are described: G. duchaussoisi sp. nov. and G. louisi sp. nov.; these are compared to the common Paleogene G. ypresiensis which is refigured. Another triakid taxon, the genus Gomphogaleus gen. nov., is described. Most of the triakids have been recorded elsewhere in the North Atlantic region, suggesting a wider distribution than expected for these small sharks during the Paleogene. The present paper updates the list of selachians from Prémontré, bringing the number of taxa from 19 to 33 (including 22 sharks and 11 batoids) and improving our knowledge of the ancient North Atlantic Ypresian selachian fauna. Despite this vastly improved record, it is clear that fossil data are still very incomplete and insufficient for calibrating phylogenetic hypotheses of living forms. Review of the Prémontré fauna shows that the Triakidae were much more diverse and broadly distributed than at present, suggesting that the limited distribution and low diversity of living forms is probably a recent phenomenon.",Adnet,"Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 53 (3): 433–448",Journal article,English,L,,"L_26451, L_26452, L_26453, L_26454, L_26455",adnet & cappetta 2008,Adnet & Cappetta 2008

We performed the first detailed comparative description of teeth belonging to most of the living and fossil mobulids. Based on a survey of living devilrays, three dental morphologies are newly identified as cobblestone tooth plates, comb-like teeth, and peg-like teeth. In addition, all extinct mobulid species are reviewed with comments on their dentition, fossil record, and geographical distribution. As a result, three fossil mobulid taxa are newly described from the Late Eocene of south-west Morocco (Argoubia barbei gen. et sp. nov., Oromobula dakhlaensis gen. et sp. nov., and Eoplinthicus underwoodi sp. nov.). This has permitted the first assessment of the phylogenetic positions of extinct and extant species of mobulids, using cladistic analyses and a combined data set of nondental anatomical characters from the literature and the dental characters defined here. Our new results support the monophyly of mobulids including all living and most extinct species and indicate that mobulids are closely related to rhinopterids. They also indicate that there was a recent split within Mobulidae into the three tooth morphology groups that we describe in this paper. This work provides clues to the evolutionary history of this clade since the Early Eocene, including the gradual lack in tooth interlocking toward the filter-feeding strategy, whereas the preservation of cusped teeth without feeding function in modern filter-feeder mobulids is interpreted as a tool for precopulatory purposes.",Adnet,"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 166 (1): 132–159",Journal article,English,L,"L_1208, L_1210","L_1205, L_1208, L_10654, L_10681, PBDB_19302",adnet et al. 2012a,Adnet et al. 2012a

Being often harvested in their restricted area, few are known about their biology and their evolutionary history despite a very peculiar dental pattern making it easy to track their fossil record. An abundant material consisting of isolated teeth from Late Bartonian (38–40 Ma) lagoonal deposits of Djebel el Kébar, Tunisia, allows to describe a new stingray, Pastinachus kebarensis nov. sp. This taxon represents the oldest occurrence for this genus but also the oldest fossil record for hypolophins. A dental comparison of these fossils with 3D rendered models of fresh specimens testifies that early hypolophin representatives had already a strongly arcuate and bulbous upper jaw, interlocking with a broad and elongated tooth plate on the lower jaw. This new fossil and its fossil relatives (here updated), indicate a pre-Bartonian origination for hypolophins in western Neotethys, and reveal a rapid and widespread colonization of the proto-Mediterranean Sea, western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific coasts during the late Paleogene–early Neogene.

"Adolfssen, J.",2012,,Palaeoenvironment and Shark Evolution across the K/T-boundary on Southern Zealand.,University of Copenhagen,,"The chondrichthyan faunal evolution across the Cretaceous/Tertiary-boundary, have been analysed from collected fossil shark teeth from Stevns Klint, Faxe Kalkbrud and a few other localities in Denmark. The teeth have been collected from the upper Maastrichtian Chalk, the K/T-boundary clay Fiskeler, the early Danian Cerithium Limestone and the middle Danian Bryozoan Limestone. Furthermore oxygen isotopes extracted from the teeth revealed the temperature development across the boundary and yielded indications on paleobathymetry. The chondrichthyan fauna at Stevns Klint during the Late Maastrichtian was very diverse with at least 27 different species. A major reduction of fauna diversity took place in the uppermost Maastrichtian marl, reducing the fauna to only four species prior to the impact layer of the boundary clay. During the deposition of the Fiskeler, the chondrichthyan diversity started to increase and the majority of the species present in the Maastrichtian Chalk is also found in the upper Fiskeler (layer V) and in the Cerithium Limestone. Only nine species went extinct (33%) which is in deep contrast to the Moroccan localities, where almost 96% of the species went extinct. The oxygen isotopes extracted from the shark teeth have revealed that the sea surface temperature fell slightly prior to the boundary and may have declined almost four degrees centigrade across the K/T-boundary. Subsequently the temperature rose during the deposition the upper layer of Fiskeler and the Cerithium Limestone. The striking fall in shark diversity prior to the boundary cannot be explained by a bolide impact and must have another explanation. This could have been caused by a sudden change in bathymetry. The calculated temperature range between sea surface and bottom water temperatures could suggest so. The extinction event which apparently almost devastated the low latitude chondrichthyan fauna in Morocco cannot be supported at Stevns Klint. The claimed major extinction event which has been assumed to have impacted the chondrichthyans at the K/T-boundary is here assumed to be primarily a result of the analysing technic used rather than a real extinction event. With the present data it is not possible to conclude whether the extinction event was a result of an instantly event or happened gradually, but the impact on the chondrichthyans was much less severe than previously assumed. By the mid Danian the shark fauna had changed radically from the uppermost Maastrichtian – lowermost Danian fauna presumably as a consequence of a change in bathymetry.

To evaluate these ecological changes, the elasmobranch fauna of the fully marine, carbonate-rich beds was investigated. A diverse fauna with 24 taxa of sharks and rays was identified with the dominant groups being carcharhiniforms and myliobatiforms. This faunal composition is similar to other early Miocene assemblages from the proto-Carribbean bioprovince. However, the Pirabas Formation has unique features compared to the other localities; being the only Neogene fossil fish assemblage described from the Atlantic coast of Tropical Americas. Phosphate oxygen isotope composition of elasmobranch teeth served as proxies for paleotemperatures and paleoecology. The data are compatible with a predominantly tropical marine setting with recognized inshore and offshore habitats with some probable depth preferences (e.g., Aetomylaeus groups). Paleohabitat of taxa particularly found in the Neogene of the Americas (‚Ä†Carcharhinus ackermannii, ‚Ä†Aetomylaeus cubensis) are estimated to have been principally coastal and shallow waters.

The benthic life is dominated by suspension-feeding bivalves and carnivores including mainly gastropods and crustaceans. Herbivores are strikingly rare.

Additionally, deep and narrow incisions at the outer lip of the apertures of gastropod shells are reported for the first time and proposed to be caused by crustaceans.

A decade of collecting, mostly by crews from the Museum of Northern Arizona, has secured specimens representing a dinosaur, at least fi ve different shortnecked plesiosaur genera, two genera of turtles, and a normal marine chondrichthyan–osteichthyan assemblage typical for the U.S. Western Interior. Most of the material is early and middle Turonian in age, refl ecting farthest offshore conditions. Larger vertebrates are less common in the Cenomanian part of the formation, probably because of nearer-shore conditions. Chondrichthyans are represented mostly by teeth and dermal ossicles. The genera Cretoxyrhina, Cretolamna, Squalicorax, Scapanorhyncus, Ptychotrygon, and Ptychodus are most common. Osteichthyans are represented by both fragments and complete articulated skeletons. The osteichthyan assemblage is dominated by ichthyodectids such as Xiphanctinus, but remains largely unsampled and unstudied. Two genera of chelonians are known: the marine form Desmatochelys, and the nearshore genus Naomichelys. The plesiosaurs are represented by the relict pliosaurid Brachauchenius and four genera of polycotylids, Palmulasaurus, Trinacromerum, Eopolycotylus, and Dolichorhynchops. The lone dinosaur recovered is a remarkably complete specimen of the bizarre therizinosaur theropod, Nothronychus. Longnecked plesiosaurs remain unknown from the Tropic Shale.

This research also reports the results of a paleontological exploration through the different Paleocene-Miocene sedimentary geological units in the surroundings of Palenque; the fossils thus collected belong to the same groups of those found within the archaeological Maya context. These results suggest that such geological units are the sources of all these fossils. In this exercise, three types of anthropogenic features produced by the Maya people were discovered on the fossils. Paint stains and plaster spots suggest that these fossils were painted. The pronounced differential wearing marks in some regions along the cutting edges of shark teeth and ray tail spines show that these fossils were used as cutting tools. Besides, the surfaces excavated around fossils preserved in slabs demonstrate that some Maya people intended on discovering and recognizing these objects, as modern paleontologists do.",Alvarado-Ortegaa," Journal of Archaeological Science–Reports, 17): 462–476",Journal article,English,L,"L_36, L_37, L_38, L_39","L_6843, L_6844, L_6845, L_6989, L_699, L_6990, L_7025, L_7083",alvarado ortega et al. 2018,Alvarado-ortega et al. 2018

Most taxa are known only by isolated rostral spines, whereas skeletal remains are rare and have been reported from a small number of Upper Cretaceous localities. Here, we describe skeletal remains of the giant sclerorhynchiform Onchosaurus pharao for the first time, which provides new morphological information. The single specimen comes from middle-basal upper Turonian strata of the Lessini Mountains in northeastern Italy and represents the first record of this genus from Italy. The specimen consists of unidentifiable cranial remains, several diagnostic rostral spines, the rostrum with fragments of tessellated calcified cartilage, and 87 disarticulated vertebrae. The rostrum preserves the characteristic sensory system of sclerorhynchiforms. It is devoid of any lateral sockets indicating that rostral spines were attached laterally to its surface. This pattern is identical to most sclerorhynchiforms and extant pristiophoriformes implying also similar replacement patterns as in most other sclerorhynchiforms with the exception for Schizorhiza. Additionally, the bases of two longitudinally arranged rows of ventral rostral spines are identifiable concurring with patterns seen in Sclerorhynchus. The axial skeleton is partly preserved. Re-arranging the disarticulated vertebrae according to their life position in combination with measures of the size and thickness of preserved vertebral centra, and the ratio rostrum length/body size depending on the number of vertebral centra indicate that the specimen was ca. 450 cm long. Growth rings in the vertebral centra show that the specimen was about four years old and thus probably not yet fully sexual mature when it died. This age assumption corresponds well with the calculated size when compared with complete skeletons of extinct sclerorhynchiforms and extant pristiforms. The size of the specimen and its occurrence in hemipelagic rocks corroborates previous assumptions that this sclerorhynchiform was a large and pelagic sawfish.",Amalfitano,"Cretaceous Research, 69: 124–135",Abstract,English,L,L_2742,L_4277,amalfitano et al. 2017a,Amalfitano et al. 2017a

This study uses scanning electron microscopy to investigate the orientation of the parallel enameloid bundles in the area of the serrated cutting edges in certain fossil elasmobranchs. The examined teeth come from two Upper Cretaceous Squalicorax species and the Upper Miocene carcharhiniforms Galeocerdo sp., Carcharhinus sp., and Hemipristis serra. The parallel bundles are revealed by surface etching, which removes the superficial shiny-layered enameloid. In the teeth of Squalicorax, the bundles around the cutting edge bend once, before they reach the serrations. The studied carcharhiniform species show a more complicated pattern with a change of parallel bundle course inside the serrations. H. serra teeth do not display the first bending of the bundles, whereas it was present in the other two carcharhiniforms. The course of the crystalline bundles in both Squalicorax species is not affected by the presence of the serrations, regardless of the twofold difference in tooth size between them. In the carcharhiniform species, the bended bundles occur within the primary and secondary serrations and are always associated with them. This feature might have functional significance by strengthening the cutting edge or could simply develop as a consequence of the enameloid mineralization around the individual serrae. Microsc. Res.

"Antar, M.S.M.",2011,,Paleo-environments of the exposed Eocene Sediments between Wadi El-Hitan and east Siwa in the Egyptian Western Desert based on their faunal content especially the vertebrates.,Zagazig University,,"Basilosaurus, Harlan 1834, is an unusual archaic whale with a serpentine body. It lived during the middle and late ages of the Eocene epoch before the appearance of the modern toothed and baleen whales.Three species are known: B.drazindai Gingerich et al. 1997, from the Drazinda Formation of Pakistan (South Asia: 38.5 Ma); B. isis (Andrews) 1904, from the Gehannam and Birket Qarun formations of Egypt (North Africa: 37 Ma); and B. cetoides (Owen) 1839, from the Moodys Branch and Yazoo Clay formations of southeastern North America (37-34 Ma). The first species is known from a single vertebra, the second is known from skulls and partial skeletons that have never been fully described, and the third is known from several partial skeletons assembled into a composite that is incomplete. In the present study, field exploration recovered a complete skeleton of B. isis (Andrews) from Wadi El-Hitan in western Fayum Province, Egypt. It was used principally for a full description of its unusual body form and a functional interpretation of its swimming. The present recovery of a complete specimen will also enhance the publicity of both whale evolution in general and the unique richness and importance of the fossil record of early whales from Egypt. The Wadi El-Hitan - Tibaghbagh area contains especial valuable fossil concentrates at which attentions are focused on the fossils of ancient whales; from the earliest, and now extinct, suborder of whales, the Archaeoceti (or archaeocetes). Its time coverage spanned an extended time interval. The rocks within the nominated property were deposited over a time of 3-4million years covering the time interval of the Middle to Late Eocene transition (40 – 37 Ma). Richness of species diversity in the studied areaexhibits a diverse marine fauna, including 25 genera of more than 14 families, 10orders and 4 classes of vertebrates. These are the ancestors of the two modern suborders of cetaceans (Mysticeti and Odontoceti). The whale fossils represent one of the iconic stories of evolution: the emergence of the whales as modern ocean-going mammals from a previous life as land-based animals. The whales of the studied area, in evolutionary terms, are amongst the youngest archaeocetes, and are in the last stages of losing their hind limbs and have taken on the typical streamlined body form of modern whales, whilst retaining certain primitive aspects of skull and tooth structure. This represents a transition from living only in shallow coastal waters to being ocean-going animals, able to spread worldwide. Four stratigraphic sections were selected and measured in the studied area, between Wadi El-Hitan and the eastern part of Siwa Oasis near Tibaghbagh escarpments. These sections were investigated for their lithological characteristics as well as paleontological contents. It is easy to trace four formations in the studied area; they are starting by the Gharq Formation, Gehannam Formation, Birket Qarun Formation and ended by Qasr El - Sagha Formation. In 2005, Wadi El-Hitan was established as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its fossils of global significance. Wadi El-Hitan is part of a larger region in the Fayum Province of Egypt, which is internationally known for its Eocene-Oligocene vertebrate fauna. Wadi El-Hitan has been the site of extensive research by the University of Michigan since the 1970’s, when Professor Philip Gingerich began his fieldwork in Egypt. Since that time, it has been necessary to prepare and replicate the fossils outside of Egypt, as the country lacks any professional preparation laboratory or staff. So it is found necessary also, to introduce the basic techniques of preparation in the present study. This include show to use airscribes for removing sediment from specimens, and how to do a variety of molding and casting techniques using different materials (for example: silicone and polyurethane layered molds supported by mother molds; hollow casts in polyester). These techniques have proven to be very useful for the technical and methodical daily work in Egypt, and greatly improved my knowledge about how to properly work with vertebrate fossils in the field and in the local lab that we have started in Wadi El- Hitan. The Eocene rocks of the Fayum – Siwa stretch in the Egyptian Western Desert (especially Wadi El Hitan in Fayum province) are well known from long time agoowing to their fossil vertebrates. On the other hand, extensive surface collecting, supplemented with bulk samples, has produced large collections from the Tibaghbagh area and Gehannam, Birket Qarun and Qasr El-Sagha formations. Members of this collection spanned the Bartonian and Priabonian where the environments varying from open muddy shelf to very shallow estuarine systems. In total of about 90 species of sharks and rays have been recorded and identified; many of them were previously unrecognized, representing some of the most diverse fossil chondrichthy an assemblages known from the Tertiary. Teeth of these species suggest that they occupied a wide range of ecological niches from top predator to tiny benthic invertebrate feeders to planktivores. Many of the recorded species are limited in their stratigraphical range, and show potential to be used, at least locally, as biostratigraphical indicators for stratigraphically poorly constrained vertebrate sites elsewhere in North Africa. Distinctly, different faunas from different sedimentary environments indicate strong environmental control on the distribution of many species.

"Antunes, M.T.",1972,,Faunules ichtyologiques oligo-miocènes de Guinée portugaise.,Revista da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa,,"Fish remains have been found in cores from two water-drillings at Binar ( —99 m) and Cacheu ( - 54 m), in Portuguese Guinea. From the first of these localities, only a rather primitive tooth of Galeocerdo has been recovered. This, besides the fact that the drilling was carried on quite near Oligocene-Miocene cartographical limits, suggest as possible an oligocene age for this fossil. The assemblage found at Cacheu is more varied and seems to be Lower Miocene in age. Taxonomy of miocene Nurse-Sharks (Ginglymostoma) is discussed; new specimens show that distinction between G. delfortriei and G. malembeense cannot be demonstrated at present. Comparisons have been established in order to ascertain the affinities of Carcharhinus, batoid and Sphyraena remains. Fossil Sphyraena from Cacheu is clearly related to a group of species reaching a large size, still represented (and common) in tropical seas.

Forty-five taxa were identified belonging to he orders Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes, Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, Torpediniformes and Myliobatiformes. The Carcharhiniformes make up about 40% of the selachian fauna that has been identified in the studied area. The families Scyliorhinidae, Triakidae, Hermigaleidae, Carcharhinidae and Sphyrnidae, and fifteen species are recognized. The distribution of the Carcharhiniformes by the Santa Margarida, Esbarrondadoiro and Vale de Zebro localities is shown (Table 1). The quantitative taxa distribution among these localities is very unequal. The predominant forms are Premontreia (Oxyscyllium) cf. dachiardi, Mustelus sp., Paragaleus antunesi, and especially Carcharhinus cf. perezi. The rarity of the tiger-shark, Galeocerdo, is interesting. Its decline in european seas was then obvious. It represents the last ocurrence in the Miocene of Portugal. The different distribution of the Carcharhiniformes (as well as that of the other orders) by the three sites points out to distinct environments in the corresponding areas: Esbarrondadoiro indicates relatively deeper, rather still waters; Santa Margarida represents a very littoral area and rough waters; while Vale de Zebro was a (probably inner) part of a gulf with muddy bottoms. Stenotherm, termophilous forms that were common or plentiful before are absent. The near absence of Galeocerdo gives a similar indication, as well as the total lack of termophilous crocodilians that were common until the Middle Miocene and still were represented in the Tortonian. At the Alvalade Basin localities there are several ""temperate"" elements"" that still are present in Portuguese waters. However the high frequence of Carcharhinus, a genus that is scarce at present off Portugal, indicates waters somewhat warmer than today¬¥s but less warm than during Tortonian times. This is corroborated by the large number of Dasyatis species and the rarity of Raja. We may conclude that moderately warm (less warm than during Tortonian, but warmer than today¬¥s) waters predominated in tha Alvalade Basin close by the end of Miocene. The scarcity of pelagic forms and especially of the larger pelagic predators points out to a quite narrow gulf and not to an open Atlantic front. The faunal differences between the Tortonian near Lisbon and the Messinian of the Alvalade Basin also indicate a rather confined gulf here in contrast with the open sea environments recognized for the Tortonian near Lisbon. Among the modernity signs of the Alvalade Basin selachian fauna in comparision with earlier Miocene ones are the highly developed characters of Galeocerdo and Carcharhinus.",Antunes,"Revista Española de Paleontología, 19 (1): 73-92",Journal article,Portugese,L,,"L_26260, L_26261, L_26262, L_26263, L_26264, L_26265, L_26266, L_26267, L_26268, L_26269, L_26270, L_26271, L_26320, L_26321, L_26322, L_26323, L_26324, L_26325, L_26326, L_26327, L_26328, L_26329, L_26330, L_26331, L_26332, L_10505, L_10506, L_10507, L_10508, L_10509, L_1051, L_10510, L_10511, L_10512",antunes & balbino 2004,Antunes & Balbino 2004

This occurrence further broadens its already huge distribution. It is indeed the first Pliocene shark so far identified in Portugal. The great white shark is represented but by a single upper right lateral tooth lost after use from a ca. 4 m TL, adult individual. The presence is very much in agreement with all known data about Iberian Peninsula, where it really has never been found in Miocene units but becomes common in lower Pliocene levels in Spain. Although the evidence is typical, it is too scarce to allow much speculation on the species numerical importance. If however we take into account that no other shark teeth are known in the concerned sediments it can provisorily be accepted that its occurrence would be rather common. This new record for the Pliocene in Portugal underlines the closeness of the first known occurrences for the eastern Atlantic, both in its northern (as this is the case) and southern parts as shown by the referred Pliocene fauna of Farol das Lagostas, Angola.

",Universidad Nacional Mayor De San Marcos,,"The evolution of Carcharodon carcharias is a theme of discussion among those who state it belongs to an ancient lineage (60 million years), and those who propose a more recent origin (6 million years) from Isurus hastalis. In this thesis Isurus oxyrinchus is proposed as the direct ancestor of C. carcharias, based on morphological, stratigraphic, phylogenetic, ontogenetic and ecological principles. Once the species and morphologies under study were defined, they were related to the Stratigraphic Levels and Formations where they were found, so as to determine the age in which each species developed, proving in this way a gradual change. In order to give more support to these observations, the results were compared with a phylogenetic analysis of the involved species and an ontogenetic analysis based on the two living species involved (I. oxyrinchus and C. carcharias); moreover, comparisons were made of the habitat and food of the extant species with the paleoenvironment and fauna of the geological formations involved in this study. The results obtained show concordance with a gradual evolution model, which caused the appearance of C. carcharias from initial species morphologically identical to the extant I. oxyrinchus which it was transforming in successive geologic stages producing other 7 chronospecies before the apparition of the morphology of the extant C. carcharias. This evolutionary process may have started approximately 27 million years ago. Besides, it was concluded that the apomorphic characters in this anagenetic series correspond to the final stages of a process of Peramorphosis (appearance of new Hyper-adult characters). It was also concluded that a coastal environment had a positive effect on the acceleration of the evolutionary processes that cause that a primarily pelagic species (I. oxyrinchus, which has been remained morphologically stable for approximately 27 million years) is transformed, through a series of geologically fast morphological changes, in a new species of mainly coastal habits (C. carcharias).

The material described here includes more than 18 marine and freshwater taxa most of which were previously unreported from the area. Jabal Zaltan is one of the very few early Miocene Afroarabian fossil sites that produced such a diverse fish sample. Therefore, the fossils described here provide a unique insight into the composition of the early Miocene fish faunas from the northern African coast; a critical time period for faunas of the continent, as contact with Eurasia ended 100 million years of African isolation. In addition, the Jabal Zaltan fossils help consolidate the validity of Galeocerdo mayumbensis and extend its geographic range to include the Tethys. The Maradah deposits also host the first occurrences of two genera (Pteromylaeus, Distichodus) in the fossil record. The fish finds support the presumed depositional environment that of tropical shallow estuarine to deltaic conditions, and the freshwater fishes document the presence of a modern-type Nilosudanian fauna containing elements with both African and Asian affinities. The Jabal Zaltan ichthyofauna, with its diversity of taxa, has the potential to become a key reference fauna for future studies of early Miocene African fishes.",Argyriou,"Journal of African Earth Sciences, 102: 86-101",Journal article,English,L,L_44,"L_7221, L_7222, L_7223, L_7224, L_7225",argyriou et al. 2015,Argyriou et al. 2015

Comparisons are made with fossil and modern shark teeth abnormalities. A coalescent set of two Squalicorax pristodontus teeth is described. The gibbous shape of the crown is similar to that in S. kaupi, the preceding species of the same lineage. It therefore suggests that the differentiation of the most derived species S. pristodontus may have resulted from kaupi through size increase and development of jaws, becoming more spacious, with teeth getting broader mesio-distally. An abnormal Carcharocles megalodon tooth is described. We regard it as a left lateral tooth from the mandible, whose crown is much deformed. Its features suggest trauma resulting from a feeding accident, maybe through biting the very compact bones of its more likely common prey, Halianassa sirenians. The last case concerns an abnormal Negaprion tooth. The most remarkable differences apart from the normal teeth concern the crown, which is irregular in shape. It shows some torsion, which also occurs in the root. A well-marked notch occurs in the mesial side. The cusp is somewhat labially bent. Trauma on the tooth-forming tissues seems to be responsible for the abnormalities under study. As far as we could ascertain, no lemon-shark dental abnormalities have previously been described. Our results stress that tooth modifications resulting from injuries to the tooth-producing tissues occurred since long ago in similar ways as in extant sharks. Biting prey's hard skeletal parts seems as always the main cause for injuries.",Balbino,"Comptes Rendus, Palevol, 6 (3): 197-209",Journal article,French,L,"L_660, L_661, L_662","L_8033, L_8034, L_8035",balbino & antunes 2007,Balbino & Antunes 2007

Tooth damage consists of splintering, cracking, and flaking near the cusp apex where the enameloid is broken and exposes the osteodentine and orthodentine. Such damage is generally viewed as the result of forces applied during feeding as the cusp apex impacts the skeletal anatomy of prey. Damage seen in serrated functional teeth from sharks Squalicorax kaupi [1] and Squalicorax pristodontus [1] from the late Cretaceous lowermost Navesink Formation of New Jersey resembles that occurring in modern sharks and suggests similar feeding behavior. Tumbling experiments using serrated modern and fossil functional shark teeth, including those of Squalicorax, show that teeth are polished, not cracked or broken, by post-mortem abrasion in lowermost Navesink sediment. This provides further evidence that chipped and broken Squalicorax teeth are feeding-related and not taphonomic in origin.

Tooth deformities occur as bent or twisted tooth crowns, missing or misshaped cusps, atypical protuberances, perforations, and abnormal root structures. Deformed tooth files consisting of unusually overlapped or small teeth, or teeth misaligned in the jaw also occur in modern forms, but deformed tooth files generally are not recognizable in fossils due to post-mortem dissociation of teeth and jaws. A survey of 200 modern lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks as well as literature sources indicate that such deformities are produced by feeding-related injury to the tooth-forming tissue of the jaws, particularly by impaction of chondrichthian and teleost fin and tail spines. Tooth counts for several late Cretaceous genera, based on material recovered from coastal plain sites from New Jersey to Alabama, suggest that the frequency of occurrence of deformed teeth in a species varies from about 0.015% in Squalicorax kaupi to about 0.36% in Paranomotodon sp. Tooth counts for modern lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks yield a comparable range in frequency of tooth deformities. Variation in frequency of tooth deformity may reflect interspecific differences in feeding behavior and dietary preferences. There is no suggestion in our data of any strong patterns of temporal variation in tooth deformity frequency, or of patterns ­reflecting chondrichthian phylogenetic history and evolution. Skeletal components of the probable prey of the Cretaceous species are preserved in the same horizons as the deformed teeth, and also are found within co-occurring chondrichthian coprolites.",Becker,"Lethaia, 33 (2): 103–118",Journal article,English,L,"L_2111, L_2112, L_2113, L_2114","L_28944, L_28945, L_28946, L_28947, L_28948, L_28949, L_2895, L_28950, L_28951, L_28952, L_28953, L_28954, L_28955, L_2896, L_2897, L_28974, L_28976, L_28977, L_28978, L_28979, L_2898, L_28980, L_28981, L_28982",becker et al. 2000,Becker et al. 2000

The assemblage consists of genera (e.g., Rhombodus, Carcharias, Serratolamna, Ischyrhiza) widely known from Upper Cretaceous rocks of the Western Interior, and from other parts of North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. This middle Fairpoint assemblage contains many of the same chondrichthyan genera reported by Cicimurri (1998) from the lignitic Stoneville lithofacies of the upper part of the Fairpoint Member. Fairpoint chondrichthyans are probably roughly equivalent in age to the chondrichthyans from the Timber Lake Member of the Fox Hills Formation in North Dakota, and are probably older than the chondrichthyan assemblage from the Breien Member of the Hell Creek Formation. The Breien, Timber Lake, and Fairpoint chondrichthyans are the youngest transitional marine chondrichthyan assemblages yet recovered from Cretaceous rocks of the Western Interior. The Fairpoint Member assemblage consists of chondrichthyan species different from those of the Paleocene Cannonball Formation of North Dakota.

","The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic composition of the enameloid tips of teeth of Scapanorhynchus texanus, a common and widespread upper Cretaceous shark, differs from that found in the dentine inner portions of the same teeth. Using a marine 87Sr/86Sr isotopic evolution curve, we converted the 87Sr/86Sr isotopic composition of different sections of the teeth to numerical ages. Portions of fossil teeth dominated by enameloid (but that include some dentine) yield numerical ages (74.2 ± 0.8 Ma, 2 standard error [S.E.]) that fall within the upper Cretaceous, and are consistent with the known geologic age range of these fossils. As the proportion of dentine present in samples of the teeth increases, the 87Sr/86Sr-derived numerical ages trend from biostratigraphically reasonable upper Cretaceous ages to those that are far younger and biostratigraphically impossible (about 32 Ma, i.e., Oligocene). This deviation in isotopic composition (and numerical age) is likely the result of post-burial diagenetic alteration of dentine, which is generally more susceptible to such alteration than enameloid. To avoid the contaminating effects of dentine, we sampled only the enameloid portion of twelve S. texanus teeth by scratching their surfaces. The enameloid scratch samples yield numerical ages (78.8 ± 0.4 Ma, 2 S.E.) older than those obtained for any of the sectioned samples. This suggests that sampling only the surface enameloid of shark teeth is useful in reducing spurious isotopic results arising from post-burial alteration of teeth. The numerical age for the enameloid scratch samples is consistent with the known early Campanian–early Maastrichtian occurrence of S. texanus in North America and with the radiometric age of the deposit from which these samples were recovered.",Becker,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 264 (1–2): 188–194",Journal article,English,L,L_2127,L_29020,becker et al. 2008b,Becker et al. 2008b

Although this assemblage is typical of other Turonian chondrichthyan faunas in North America, fossil teeth are preserved in two unique facies associations that consist of arenitic sandstones with mud interclasts and rounded chert, feldspar, and quartz pebbles. The coarser beds within these facies associations are previously interpreted to represent storm events and turbidity flows associated with a sea level lowstand. Chondrichthyan teeth occurring within these coarser beds are indicative of extensive transport and reworking and attest to the durable nature of chondrichthyan teeth for biostratigraphic and paleoecological interpretations.

Through their long history, lamniform sharks have faced widespread extinction, and understanding those ‘natural experiments’ may help constrain predictions, placing the current crisis in evolutionary context. Here we show, using novel morphometric analyses of fossil shark teeth, that the end-Cretaceous extinction of many sharks had major ecological consequences. Post-extinction ecosystems supported lower diversity and disparity of lamniforms, and were dominated by significantly smaller sharks with slimmer, smoother and less robust teeth. Tooth shape is intimately associated with ecology, feeding and prey type, and by integrating data from extant sharks we show that latest Cretaceous sharks occupied similar niches to modern lamniforms, implying similar ecosystem structure and function. By comparison, species in the depauperate post-extinction community occupied niches most similar to those of juvenile sand tigers (Carcharias taurus). Our data show that quantitative tooth morphometrics can distinguish lamniform sharks due to dietary differences, providing critical insights into ecological consequences of past extinction episodes.",Belben,"PLoS ONE, 12 (6): e0178294",Journal article,English,L,"L_2767, L_2768, L_2769","L_4338, L_4339, L_434, L_4340, L_4341, L_4342, L_4343, L_4344, L_4345, L_4346, L_4347, L_4348, L_4349, L_435, L_4350",belben et al. 2017,Belben et al. 2017

Para la elaboración de esta tesis se ha realizado cartografica geologica de la mayor parte de los afloramientos de la depresion central asturiana y se han levantado y muestreado 25 secciones estratigraficas de detalle, complementadas con otras observaciones y muestreos en afloramientos de carácter mas puntual. Estos trabajos de campo han permitido afinar el control, bioestratigráfico de las series, identificando varias zonas de ammonites, y proponer un esquema estratigráfico secuencial, correlacionable con los establecidos por otros autores en la ""cuenca norcantabrica"", afinando más la datación de las series. Se han procesado un total de unos 2700 kg. De muestras de las que se han obtenido unos 5900 dientes de seláceos, lo que constituye la más numerosa colección de seláceos cretáciclos de españa. Sobre esta colección se han identificado y descrito 64 especies de esláceos, de las cuales 19 se descripen formalmente como nuevas, habiendose dejando otras 28 en nomenclatura abierta. Las especies identficadas se agrupan en 35 generos, de los que 6 se proponen formalmente como nuevos, y 11 familias, de las que 2 se proponen como nuevas.

Se ha realizado un estudio paleoecologico de las asociaciones de selaceos obtenidas, poniendose de manifiesto la existencia de 5 sub-unidades ecologico-evolutivas, dentro de las cuales se han analizado las variaciones en la composición y estructura de las faunas.","Thèse Doct., Univ. d'Oviedo (non publiée): 1–476, 110 fig., 1–79 pl.",Thesis,Spanish,L,"L_2283, L_2284, L_2285, L_2286, L_2287, L_2288, L_2289, L_2290, L_2291, L_2292, L_2293, L_2294, L_2295, L_2296, L_2297, L_2298, L_2299, L_2300, L_2301, L_2302, L_2303, L_2304, L_2305, L_2306, L_2307, L_2308, L_2309, L_2310, L_2311, L_2312, L_2313, L_2314, L_2315, L_2316, L_2317, L_2318, L_2319, L_2320, L_2321, L_2322, L_2323, L_2324, L_2325, L_2326, L_2327, L_2328, L_2329, L_2330, L_2331, L_2332, L_2333, L_2334, L_2335, L_2336, L_2337, L_2338, L_2339, L_2340, L_2341, L_2342, L_2343, L_2344, L_2345, L_2346, L_2347, L_2348, L_2349, L_2350, L_2351, L_2352, L_2353, L_2354, L_2355, L_2356, L_2357, L_2358, L_2359, L_2360, L_2361, L_2362, L_2363, L_2364, L_2365, L_2366, L_2367, L_2368, L_2369, L_2370, L_2371, L_2372, L_2373, L_2374, L_2375, L_2376, L_2377, L_2378, L_2379, L_2380, L_2381, L_2382, L_2383, L_2384, L_2385, L_2386, L_2387, L_2388, L_2389, L_2390, L_2391, L_2392, L_2393, L_2394, L_2395, L_2396, L_2397, L_2398, L_2399, L_2400, L_2401, L_2402, L_2403","L_29677, L_29678, L_29679, L_2968, L_29680, L_29681, L_29682, L_29683, L_29684, L_29685, L_29686, L_29687, L_29688, L_29689, L_2969, L_29690, L_29691, L_29692, L_29693, L_29694, L_29695, L_29696, L_29697, L_29698, L_29699, L_297, L_2970, L_29700, L_29701, L_29702, L_29703, L_29704, L_29705, L_29706, L_29707, L_29708, L_29709, L_2971, L_29710, L_29711, L_29712, L_29714, L_29717, L_29718, L_29719, L_2972, L_29720, L_29721, L_29722, L_29723, L_29724, L_29725, L_29727, L_29728, L_2973, L_29730, L_29732, L_29733, L_29734, L_29735, L_29736, L_29737, L_29738, L_29739, L_2974, L_29740, L_29741, L_29742, L_29743, L_29745, L_29747, L_29748, L_29749, L_2975, L_29750, L_29751, L_29752, L_29753, L_29754, L_29755, L_29766, L_29767, L_29768, L_2977, L_29770, L_29771, L_29772, L_29773, L_29774, L_29775, L_29776, L_29777, L_29778, L_29779, L_2978, L_29780, L_29781, L_29782, L_29784, L_29785, L_29786, L_29787, L_29788, L_29789, L_2979, L_29790, L_29791, L_29793, L_29794, L_29795, L_29796, L_29797, L_29798, L_298, L_2980, L_29800, L_29801, L_29802, L_29803, L_29804, L_29805, L_29807, L_29808, L_29809, L_2981, L_29810, L_29811, L_29812, L_29814, L_29815, L_29816, L_29817, L_29818, L_29819, L_2982, L_29820, L_29821, L_29822, L_29823, L_29824, L_29825, L_29826, L_29827, L_29828, L_29829, L_2983, L_29830, L_29831, L_29832, L_29833, L_29834, L_29836, L_29837, L_29839, L_2984, L_29840, L_29841, L_29842, L_29843, L_29844, L_29845, L_29846, L_29835, L_29847, L_29848, L_29849, L_2985, L_29850, L_29851, L_29852, L_29853, L_29854, L_29855, L_29857, L_29858, L_29859, L_2986, L_29860, L_29861, L_29862, L_29863, L_29864, L_29865, L_29866, L_29867, L_29868, L_29869, L_2987, L_29870, L_29871, L_29872, L_29873, L_29874, L_29878, L_29879, L_2988, L_29880, L_29881, L_29882, L_29883, L_29884, L_29885, L_29886, L_29887, L_29888, L_29889, L_2989, L_29890, L_29891, L_29892, L_29893, L_29894, L_29895, L_29896, L_29897, L_29898, L_29899, L_299, L_2990, L_29900, L_29901, L_29902, L_29903, L_29904, L_29905, L_29906, L_29907, L_29908, L_2991, L_29910, L_29911, L_29912, L_29913, L_29914, L_29915, L_29916, L_29917, L_29918, L_29919, L_2992, L_29920, L_29921, L_29922, L_29923, L_29924, L_29925, L_29926, L_29927, L_29928, L_29929, L_2993, L_29930, L_29931, L_29932, L_29933, L_29934, L_29935, L_29936, L_29942, L_29943, L_29944, L_29945, L_29946, L_29947, L_29948, L_29949, L_2995, L_29950, L_29951, L_29952, L_29953, L_29954, L_29955, L_29956, L_29957, L_29958, L_29959, L_2996, L_29960, L_29961, L_29962, L_29963, L_29964, L_29965, L_29979, L_29980, L_29981, L_29982, L_29983, L_29984, L_29985, L_29986, L_29987, L_29988, L_29989, L_2999, L_29990, L_29991, L_29992, L_29993, L_29994, L_29995, L_29996, L_29997, L_29998, L_29999, L_3, L_30, L_300, L_3000, L_30000, L_30001, L_30002, L_30003, L_30030, L_30031, L_30032, L_30033, L_30034, L_30035, L_30036, L_30037, L_30038, L_30039, L_3004, L_30040, L_30041, L_30042, L_30043, L_30044, L_30081, L_30082, L_30083, L_30084, L_30085, L_30086, L_30087, L_30088, L_30089, L_3009, L_30090, L_30091, L_30129, L_3013, L_30130, L_30131, L_30132, L_30133, L_30134, L_30135, L_30136, L_30137, L_30138, L_3015, L_30150, L_30151, L_30152, L_30153, L_30154, L_30155, L_30156, L_30157, L_30158, L_30159, L_3016, L_30165, L_30166, L_30167, L_30168, L_29769, L_29838, L_29856, L_2998, L_29713",bernardez 2002,Bernárdez 2002

These islands, situated in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, can be con¬¨sidered a mid-way stopover point between the Caribbean Sea, with the Central American Seaway about to close in this epoch, and the Mediterranean, in the first stage of its post-Messinian Gibraltar Seaway period. Accordingly, there existed extensive pantropical communication, particularly for nektonic animals capable of travelling large dis¬¨tances. In this paper, we present a number of fossil fishes, most of which are identified for the first time on the basis of their teeth: the Chondrichthyes species Carcharocles megalodon, Parotodus benedeni, Cosmopolitodus has¬¨talis, Isurus oxyrinchus, Carcharias cf. acutissima, Carcharhinus cf. leucas, Carcharhinus cf. priscus, Galeocerdo cf. aduncus, and the Osteichthyes species Archosargus cinctus, Labrodon pavimentatum, and Diodon scillae.

The analysis of Recent data (stomach content reports, eyewitnesses' depositions about predation on living cetaceans and scavenging signs on the carcasses) shows that cetaceans represent a significant component of the diet of Carcharodon carcharias. Fossil evidences (cetacean bones marked by white shark bites and white shark teeth in close relation with skeletal remains of cetaceans) suggest sharks-cetaceans trophic interaction in the Pliocene too. A comparison between Recent and fossil data lets us presume that in the Pliocene both Mysticeti and Odontoceti were equally represented in the Carcharodon carcharias diet. On the contrary in the Recent the white shark interaction is principally directed to little-sized toothed whales and just rarely to mysticetes baleen whales. This change could be due to both the general reduction of the living white shark body size and the diminished diversity of the cetacean assemblage.",Bianucci,"Proceedings of the 4th European Elasmobranch Association Meeting, Livorno, (Italy) 2000: 33-48",Conference article,English,L,"L_161, L_162, L_163","L_2257, L_228, L_2367",bianucci et al. 2000,Bianucci et al. 2000

Coupled with ichnological observations, the size distribution of pyrite framboid relics reveals fluctuation of euxinic and oxic-dysoxic conditions at the seafloor. The assemblage is dominated by toothed cetaceans (kentriodontids, squalodelphinids, physeteroids, and the eurhinodelphinid-like Chilcacetus), together with a large dermochelyid turtle, some bony fish, and diverse elasmobranchs, mostly juveniles of Carcharhinus brachyurus and Cosmopolitodus hastalis. The vertebrate assemblage comprises a coastal community, dominated by mesopredators, representative of a warm-temperate, sheltered embayment connected with riverine and open ocean environments. Vertebrate skeletons are typically disarticulated and incomplete, and some bone elements display shark bite marks. Microborings are observed at the bone surface. Bones exhibit a good degree of apatite mineralisation and bone cavities are locally filled by Ca-Mg carbonates. Our taphonomic observations suggest prolonged flotation of carcasses during which they were subject to biogenic and physical processes of partial destruction (including scavenging by sharks), before final deposition on a soft compact substrate.

As such, establishment of a concrete taphonomic model for shallow marine vertebrate assemblages is lacking. The Neogene Purisima Formation of Northern California, a richly fossiliferous unit recording nearshore to offshore depositional settings, offers a unique opportunity to examine preservational trends across these settings. Methodology/Principal Findings: Lithofacies analysis was conducted to place vertebrate fossils within a hydrodynamic and depositional environmental context. Taphonomic data including abrasion, fragmentation, phosphatization, articulation, polish, and biogenic bone modification were recorded for over 1000 vertebrate fossils of sharks, bony fish, birds, pinnipeds, odontocetes, mysticetes, sirenians, and land mammals. These data were used to compare both preservation of multiple taxa within a single lithofacies and preservation of individual taxa across lithofacies to document environmental gradients in preservation. Differential preservation between taxa indicates strong preservational bias within the Purisima Formation. Varying levels of abrasion, fragmentation, phosphatization, and articulation are strongly correlative with physical processes of sediment transport and sedimentation rate. Preservational characteristics were used to delineate four taphofacies corresponding to inner, middle, and outer shelf settings, and bonebeds. Application of sequence stratigraphic methods shows that bonebeds mark major stratigraphic discontinuities, while packages of rock between discontinuities consistently exhibit onshore-offshore changes in taphofacies. Conclusions/Significance: Changes in vertebrate preservation and bonebed character between lithofacies closely correspond to onshore-offshore changes in depositional setting, indicating that the dominant control of preservation is exerted by physical processes. The strong physical control on marine vertebrate preservation and preservational bias within the Purisima Formation has implications for paleoecologic and paleobiologic studies of marine vertebrates. Evidence of preservational bias among marine vertebrates suggests that careful consideration of taphonomic overprint must be undertaken before meaningful paleoecologic interpretations of shallow marine vertebrates is attempted.",Boessenecker,"PLoS ONE, 9 (3): e91419",Journal article,English,L,L_360,"L_6846, L_6847, L_6848, L_6849, L_685, L_6850, L_6851, L_6852, L_6853, L_6854, L_6855, L_6856, L_6857, L_6858, L_6859",boessenecker et al. 2014,Boessenecker et al. 2014

This tooth is referable to H. silvestris based both in morphological and histological reliable evidence. This record also allows the reassignment of MML 228 to this genera and species, instead the original assignation to the genus Pseudohypolophus. Additionally, it represents the southernmost occurrence of the genus Hypolophodon and the first record for South America. The marine Ichtyofauna of the Jaguel Formation from north Patagonia evidences a strong relationship with coeval ichtyofauna from Brazil, Caribbean, North Africa and Madagascar, showing a clear distinction with selachian faunas from the Weddelian biogeographic Province.

The sharks and rays reflect mainly a shallow marine environment, although bathyal forms also occur. In spite of nearby delta-sequences, the conditions almost never were really brackish. Occasional weak decrease of salinity is partly indicated. The age of the sediments is considered to be approximately 18 milion years old. based onto Sr-isotope analysis.

These teeth were arranged and compared with other disarticulated associated sets, then compared with a known articulated tooth set; resulting in a multi-perspective Cretoxyrhina tooth set.

After the taking of Maastricht in November 1794 by the French revolutionary army in war against the Stadholder, William V, several collections of “petrifications” from the underground quarries of Sint Pietersberg were acquired by Augustin-Lucie de Frécine, Représentant du Peuple, and by André Thoüin and Barthélémy Faujas de Saint-Fond, both Commissioners charged for collecting objects of science and art in the conquered countries. These fossils were sent to Paris in 1795 and subsequently described and figured between 1799 and 1803 by Faujas de Saint-Fond in his Histoire naturelle de la Montagne de Saint-Pierre de Maestricht. Unpublished drawings by Nicolas Maréchal (1753–1802), painter at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris) as well as new bibliographic data concerning Faujas de Saint-Fond's book are presented here for the first time. The fish remains (Chondrichthyes and Actinopterygii) depicted in this book are reviewed. Searches in the Collection of Paleontology of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris) have yielded the rediscovery of both teeth of Squalicorax pristodontus (Agassiz, 1835) and the tooth of Cretolamna lata (Agassiz, 1838) figured by Faujas de Saint-Fond. These historic fossils are the first specimens of the genus Squalicorax Whitley, 1939 et Cretolamna Glickman, 1958 figured in a publication. In addition, an unpublished drawing made in 1811 when Cuvier was on a tour of inspection of the establishments of public instruction in Holland, enables to retrace the history of the holotype of Enchodus faujasi Agassiz, 1843. This specimen was originally kept in the National Cabinet of Natural History in Amsterdam, established by the former King of Holland, Louis Bonaparte. Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt was the director of this Cabinet. He offered the fossil to the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris) where it has been kept since then.",Brignon,"Geodiversitas, 37 (1): 59–77",Journal article,French,L,L_2837,"L_4622, L_4623, L_4624, L_4625, L_4626",brignon 2015,Brignon 2015

No systematic study was undertaken on this important regional fauna unit (more than fifty recognized species). The analysis of this material and the comparisons with the current alive forms, in strong resemblance, define a marine biotope which is characterized by a not very deep sea of the neritic zone, under subtropical climate. One can note however some rare incursions of pelagic and bathyal species, which does not alter the overall character of this marine environment. This inventory made it possible to hightlight the presence of 4 genuses, that appear new in Provence region : Hexanchus (Hexanchidae), Iago (Triakidae), Scymnodon ?

"Callahan, W.R. & Johnson, R. & Mehling, C.",2010,,A new vertebrate assemblage from to Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) New Egypt formation of New Jersey,Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Seventieth Anniversary Meeting,,"Recent explorations of small creeks in the New Jersey Inner Coastal Plain have revealed a new vertebrate fauna from the Maastrichtian New Egypt Formation. Spheno Run, nick- named for common septal fragments of the ammonite Sphenodiscus lobatus, is producing a well preserved vertebrate fauna. This assemblage preserves a non-lag vertebrate bearing horizon in the lower portion of the formation approximately 8 meters below the Cretaceous/ Paleogene boundary. This part of the lower New Egypt is not well exposed elsewhere in New Jersey and represents a relatively deep water environment. Invertebrates found in as- sociation with the vertebrate fossils correlate well with the middle Severn Formation of Maryland. Spheno Run has thus far produced a diverse vertebrate fauna especially rich in marine reptiles. These include the turtles Peritresius ornatus and Taphrosphys sulcatus; the mosasaurs Prognathodon rapax, Mosasaurus hoffmanni, a probable plioplatecarpine and the plesiosaur Cimoliosaurus magnus. Chondricthyans include the associated teeth and vertebrae of a very large specimen of the anacoracid shark Squalicorax pristodontus, the lamnid sharks Cretalamna appendiculata and Odontaspis sp., the sclerorhynchid sawfish Ischyrhiza mira and the chimaeroid Edaphodon mirificus. Bony fish are represented by Enchodus ferox, Ano- moeodus robustus, Cylindracanthus ornatus, associated scales, fin spines and vertebrae of an as yet unidentified beryciform fish and rare teeth that favorably compare to the aulopiform genus Apateodus. If additional material confirms the occurrence of Apateodus it will expand the geographic range of this taxon to include the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Rare elements from the Spheno Run locality include hollow, thin-walled bone fragments representing the remains of pterosaurs and a partial maxilla from a juvenile hadrosaur. Although associated skeletal elements are found at Spheno Run articulated specimens are not. This is likely due to scattering of post mortem remains by scavenging. The evidence for this interpretation lies in the great number of bony elements that display bite and scrape marks from both small and large toothed scavengers.",Callahan,"Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Seventieth Anniversary Meeting, 2010, 68-69 ",Abstract,English,L,,"L_28885, L_28884, L_28886, L_28887",callahan et al. 2010,Callahan et al. 2010

The Maestrichtian localities have yielded a new genus and a new subspecies of Selachian: Igdabatis sigmodon nov. gen., nov. sp. and Lamna biauriculata nigeriana nov. subsp. The locality of Sessao, which has been attributed to the Thanetian by means of the study of the fish, has furnished by screen-washing an interesting fauna wherein six new species are described: Raja Iouisi, Dasyatis sessaoensis, D. sudrei, D. russelli, Hypolophites thaleri and Ceratodus casieri.

"Carlsen, A.W. & Cuny, G.",2014,,"A study of the sharks and rays from the Lillebælt Clay (Early–Middle Eocene) of Denmark, and their palaeoecology.",Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark,,"Elasmobranch assemblages from the Eocene Lillebælt Clay Formation (Late Ypresian to Middle Lutetian) at Trelde Næs in Denmark yielded teeth of 31 different genera/species from surface collecting as well as from bulk sampling. The fauna is dominated by lamniform pelagic sharks and deepwater genera like Hexanchiformes, Centrophorus, Isistius, Echinorhinus and Pristiophorus. Coupatezia miretrainensis, Centrophorus aff. granulosus and Chlamydoselachus cf. fiedleri are reported for the first time from the Ypresian. The record of Coupatezia miretrainensis extends its stratigraphic record from the Lutetian back to the Late Ypresian, whereas the record of Centrophorus aff. granulosus extends the origin of the Centrophorus granulosus group back to the Late Ypresian from its hitherto known origin in the Lutetian. The possible presence of the sparsely known Bartonian genus Turania awaits further sampling to be confirmed. The Ichthyofauna suggests deposition in a deep-water environment in subtropical to temperate waters on the middle or outer continental shelf and upper slope at water depth down to 350 m. This is in agreement with depositional depths inferred from fossil molluscs and fish otoliths from Trelde Næs.

The paleoenvironmental preferences of the members of this fauna, as well as published paleogeographic reconstructions, suggest that the Cantaure Formation was deposited in a highly-productive shallow water environment, associated with coastal upwelling. We documented a paleodiversity of 39 shark and ray species, including 15 previously unreported taxa for Venezuela and six for Tropical America. We performed a bathymetric analysis of the fossil assemblage based on the distribution of closely-related extant chondrichthyan relatives of fossil taxa and discuss the ecological role and stratigraphic significance of the latter. Our results support the hypothesis that the Cantaure Formation was deposited in an insular inner-middle shelf environment. The elasmobranch fauna is characterized by a predominance of benthopelagic sharks with piscivorous feeding preferences (e.g., †Paratodus, Galeorhinus, Hemipristis, Rhizoprionodon, Carcharhinus, Isogomphodon, Negaprion, †Physogaleus and Sphyrna) followed by durophagous/cancritrophic feeders (e.g., Heterodontus, Nebrius, Mustelus, Rhynchobatus, Pristis, Dasyatis, cf. Pteroplatytrygon, cf. Taeniurops, Aetobatus, Aetomylaeus and Rhinoptera). Filter (e.g., Mobula and †Plinthicus), eurytrophic/sarcophagous (e.g., †Carcharocles and Galeocerdo) and teuthitrophic (e.g., Alopias) feeder species were also found. Teeth of Carcharocles megalodon found in Burdigalian sediments of the Cantaure Formation support the presence of this species already in the early Miocene. Some taxa (Nebrius, Carcharhinus cf. C. macloti and Rhynchobatus) are absent from the extant Caribbean and Western Atlantic fauna, but were present in the region before the closure of the Central American Seaway.",Carrillo-Briceño,"Palaeontologia Electronica, 19.2.27-32",Journal article,English,L,"L_85, L_86, L_87, L_88","L_9270, L_9130, L_9131, L_9132, L_9133, L_9134, L_9135, L_9136, L_9137, L_9138, L_9139, L_914, L_9140, L_9141, L_9142, L_9143, L_9144, L_9145, L_9146, L_9147, L_9148, L_9149, L_915, L_9150, L_9151, L_9152, L_9153, L_9154, L_9155, L_9269, L_927, L_9271, L_9272, L_9273, L_9274, L_9275, L_9276, L_9277, L_9278, L_9279, L_928, L_9280, L_9281, L_9282, L_9283, L_9284, L_9285, L_9286, L_9287, L_9288, L_9289, L_929, L_9290, L_9291, L_9292, L_9293, L_9294, L_9295, L_9296, L_9366, L_9367, L_9368, L_9369, L_937, L_9370, L_9371, L_9372, L_9373, L_9374, L_9375, L_9376, L_9377, L_9378, L_9401, L_9402, L_9403, L_9404, L_9405, L_9406",carrillo briceno et al. 2016a,Carrillo-briceño et al. 2016a

We identified the major regions of diversity and of endemism, and explored the relations to physical variables. We found a strong relationship between shark and ray diversity with area and coastal length of each province. The Tropical Northwestern Atlantic Province is characterized by high diversity and greater occurrence of endemic species, suggesting this province as the hotspot of sharks and rays in Tropical America. The historical background for the current biogeography is explored and analyzed. Referential data from 67 geological units in 17 countries, from both shallow and deep-water habitats, across five time-clusters from the Miocene to the Pleistocene were studied. New data include 20 new assemblages from six countries. The most diverse Neogene and extant groups of shark and ray are Carcharhiniformes and Myliobatiformes, respectively. The differentiation between Pacific and Atlantic faunas goes to at least the middle Miocene, probably related with the increasing closure of the Central American Seaway acting as a barrier. The highest faunal similarity between the assemblages from the EP and the WA at the early Miocene could be related to the lack of a barrier back then, but increased sampling is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.",Carrillo-Briceño,"PeerJ, 6: e5313",Journal article,English,L,"L_100, L_101, L_102, L_103, L_104, L_105, L_106, L_107, L_108, L_109, L_110, L_111, L_114, L_115, L_116, L_117, L_118, L_119, L_120, L_121, L_122, L_123, L_124, L_125, L_126, L_127, L_128, L_129, L_130, L_131, L_132, L_133, L_134, L_135, L_136, L_137, L_138, L_139, L_140, L_141, L_142, L_95, L_96, L_97, L_98, L_99","L_10926, L_10927, L_10928, L_10929, L_1093, L_10930, L_10931, L_10932, L_10933, L_10934, L_10935, L_10936, L_10937, L_10938, L_10939, L_1094, L_10940, L_10941, L_10942, L_10980, L_11011, L_11148, L_11172, L_11173, L_11174, L_11175, L_11176, L_11177, L_11178, L_11208, L_11209, L_1121, L_11210, L_11211, L_11212, L_11213, L_11214, L_11215, L_11216, L_11217, L_11218, L_11219, L_1122, L_11220, L_11330, L_11331, L_11332, L_11366, L_11367, L_11368, L_11369, L_1137, L_11415, L_11416, L_11449, L_11554, L_11567, L_11617, L_11618, L_11619, L_1162, L_11662, L_11671, L_11672, L_11682, L_11683, L_11684, L_1180, L_11800, L_11801, L_1352, L_11865, L_11866, L_12005, L_12006, L_12007, L_1206, L_1207, L_1237, L_1238, L_1251, L_1252, L_1253, L_129, L_1290, L_1406, L_1407, L_1408, L_1409, L_141, L_1410, L_1446, L_1447, L_1448, L_1473, L_1551, L_1552, L_1553, L_1554, L_1555, L_1556, L_1557, L_1815, L_1984, L_1985, L_1986, L_1987, L_1988, L_1989, L_199, L_1990, L_1991, L_1992, L_1993, L_20068, L_20069, L_2007, L_20070, L_20071, L_20072, L_20073, L_20253, L_20254, L_20255, L_20256, L_20257, L_20258, L_20259, L_2026, L_20260, L_20373, L_20446, L_20567, L_20568, L_20569, L_2057, L_20570, L_20571, L_20572, L_20573, L_20574, L_20575, L_20682, L_20683, L_20684, L_21084, L_21085, L_21086, L_21087, L_21088, L_21089, L_21160, L_21161, L_21162, L_21252, L_21317, L_21318, L_21404, L_21405, L_21406, L_21495, L_21533, L_21534, L_21535, L_21625, L_21626, L_11908, L_21813, L_21814, L_21815, L_21816, L_21817, L_21818, L_21853, L_11966, L_1913, L_20806, L_20807, L_20808, L_209, L_20948, L_20949, L_2095, L_20950, L_20951, L_20952, L_20953, L_988, L_15883, L_9689, L_971, L_9804, L_9805, L_9806, L_9817, L_9818, L_9957, L_14581, L_14583, L_14584, L_14585, L_14588, L_14597, L_14598, L_14647, L_14648, L_14649, L_15348, L_15349, L_15881, L_15882, L_15884, L_15885, L_15886, L_15887, L_15888, L_15889, L_15890, L_15891, L_15892, L_15893, L_15894, L_15895, L_15896, L_15897, L_15898, L_16333, L_16334, L_16335, L_16336, L_16337, L_16338, L_16339, L_16340, L_16341, L_16342",carrillo briceno et al. 2018a,Carrillo-briceño et al. 2018a

During the late Oligocene through the Pliocene, much of the basin was submerged. The extensive deposits in this area suggest a transition from a shallow marine to a fluvio-deltaic system, with a rich record of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. The elasmobranch assemblages of the early Miocene to the late Pliocene succession in the Cocinetas Basin (Jimol, Castilletes and Ware formations, as well as the Pats√∫a Valley) are described for the first time. The assemblages include at least 30 taxa of sharks (Squaliformes, Pristiophoriformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes and Carcharhiniformes) and batoids (Rhinopristiformes and Myliobatiformes), of which 24 taxa are reported from the Colombian Neogene for the first time. Paleoecological interpretations are based on the feeding ecology and on estimates of the paleohydrology (relative salinity, temperature) using stable isotope compositions of oxygen in the bioapatite of shark teeth. The isotopic composition of the studied specimens corroborates paleoenvironmental settings for the studied units that were previously estimated based on the sedimentology and biology of the taxa.

Here the elasmobranch assemblages of the middle Miocene to middle Pliocene section of the Urumaco sequence (Socorro, Urumaco and Codore formations) are described. Based on new findings, we document at least 21 taxa of the Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, Myliobatiformes and Rajiformes, and describe a new carcharhiniform species (†Carcharhinus caquetius sp. nov.). Moreover, the Urumaco Formation has a high number of well-preserved fossil Pristis rostra, for which we provide a detailed taxonomic revision, and referral in the context of the global Miocene record of Pristis as well as extant species.

Poster Abstract","1st Virtual Congress of Palaeontology ""A new way to make Science""",,"In the little village of Badia a Settimo (Scandicci), close to Florence (Italy), in an old school facility, a collection of fossils of prime importance is managed by an association of volunteer, amateur palaeontologists: the G.A.M.P.S. (Gruppo AVIS Mineralogia e Paleontologia Scandicci - Mineralogical & Palaeontological AVIS Group of Scandicci). In this collection, several unique or simply very well preserved specimens have been stored and prepared, and some of them were eventually put on public exhibition. Most of the exposed specimens are fossils of vertebrates and invertebrates from the Pliocene marine deposits of Tuscany. Most of the G.A.M.P.S. invertebrate collection is comprised of gastropods, bivalves, brachiopods, echinoids and crabs. These benthic invertebrate fossils, which include some exquisitely preserved specimens, shed light on the diversity of the Pliocene biota of the central Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, the G.A.M.P.S. exhibition is enriched by a spectacular section devoted to of the marine vertebrates that lived along the coasts of Tuscany during the Pliocene: an almost complete specimen of a balaenopteroid baleen-bearing whale, together which some specimens of Metaxytherium (an extinct species of sea cow), Etruridelphis (an extinct species of dolphins), and a plethora of fishes are admirable at Badia a Settimo. In particular, the G.A.M.P.S. collection of elasmobranch teeth and spines is remarkable: over 30 species of sharks, rays and skates have been found in the Pliocene sediments of Tuscany and are now present at the G.A.M.P.S. palaeontological exhibition. Each of these species tells the visitors a different story about the biological and environmental evolution of the Mediterranean Basin during the last five million years. The G.A.M.P.S. experience highlights how the continuous collaboration between amateur and professional palaeontologists, in compliance with the laws in force and modern scientific and museological standards, has the potential to adequately highlight and give value to new palaeontological finds. The aim of the present work is to present the elasmobranch collection of the G.A.M.P.S. and to discuss the communicative strategies used to present the Pliocene world at the G.A.M.P.S. exhibition at Badia a Settimo.",Casati,"1st Virtual Congress of Palaeontology ""A new way to make Science"", 01-15 December 2018, Web.",Abstract,English,L,L_154,"L_21973, L_21974, L_21975, L_21976, L_21977, L_21978, L_21979, L_2198, L_21980, L_21981, L_21982, L_21983, L_21985, L_21986, L_21987, L_21988, L_21989, L_2199, L_21990, L_21991, L_21992, L_21993, L_21994, L_21995",casati et al. 2018,Casati et al. 2018

Belgrano and Burmeister lakes are the most important ones in this basin. Cerro Casa de Piedra 7 (CCP7) is one of several caves and rockshelters located on the northern side of the hill. CCP7 has a stratigraphic sequence which begins at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. A fossil shark tooth was found in archaeological deposits dated to about 9000–9700 rcybp; it belongs to the genus Isurus (Elasmobranchii, Lamniformes, Isuridae). This species, unknown today in Santa Cruz marine coasts, lived in Patagonian seas during the Miocene epoch, at a time when there were sea ingressions. These ingressions flooded large areas within the present Patagonian territory and generated marine deposits in which abundant remains of extinct fauna (including shark teeth) can be found (Figure 1). In this paper, the recorded fossil tooth is described and its possible modification by human action is discussed.",Castro,"In: Southbound – Late Pleistocene Peopling of Latin America.

The whole series has yielded various vertebrate assemblages. Their spatial and temporal successions allow studying the turnover of the vertebrate faunas in relation to transformations of the environments in a relatively restricted geographical area. The Cretaceous series is divided into three Formations: the Ifezouane, Aoufous and Akrabou formations from the bottom to the top. The compound assemblages of the Kem Kem beds are found mainly at the top of the Ifezouane Fm, and possibly also in the Aoufous Fm. The fossils are collected along a 250 km long cliff extending along the border with Algeria, as well as to the northwest of the town of Erfoud. The stratigraphic and geographical uncertainties associated to most of the discoveries are caused by the fact that most of the valuable scientific finds are made by local people, who do not record properly the spots of the discoveries. The compound Kem Kem beds assemblage comprises a variety of cartilaginous fishes, lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes, amphibians, squamates, turtles, crocodiles, sauropod and theropod dinosaurs, and pterosaurs. This assemblage is part of a large series of continental assemblage found in various parts of North Africa, the “Continental intercalaire” of the French geologists that ranges in age from the Early Cretaceous (possibly Jurassic) to the beginning of the Late Cretaceous. The temporal succession of the assemblage within the “Continental intercalaire” is still problematic, and no evidence for direct dating of the compound Kem Kem beds assemblage has been found so far. However, the similarities between the faunal composition of the Moroccan assemblage with the well dated assemblage of Bahariya, Egypt, indicate likely an early Cenomanian age for both assemblages. Intriguing characteristics of this assemblage are: 1) the abundance of taxa represented by large individuals, in particular in some of the fish and dinosaur groups; 2) a strange composition of the dinosaur assemblage consisting of saurischian taxa only and 3) a large proportion of remains of carnivorous dinosaurs compared to the herbivorous ones. Above the Ifezouane Fm, the Aoufous Fm is topped by carbonate marine deposits containing the ammonite Neolobites vibrayeanus, marking the base of the upper Cenomanian, and indicative of the worldwide big transgression of that time. Twenty meters above the Neolobites level occurs a shallow marine assemblage in the Kem Kem area, at the very same place as a locality called Gara Sbâa where Lavocat found dinosaur remains in the 1950s. This late Cenomanian or basal Turonian marine assemblage, called Agoult (other names are Daoura, Gara Sbâa, Oued Sebaa), contains a diversified assemblage of fishes, as well as invertebrate and plant remains. On the southern slope of the High Atlas range, to the north and northeast of the town of Goulmima, a rich marine assemblage comprising ammonites and vertebrates has been described. The ammonite Mammites nodosoides indicates a late early Turonian age. The vertebrates, generally preserved in calcareous nodules, consist mainly of teleostean fishes and marine reptiles (mosasauroids, polycotylids, elasmosaurids, protostegids). The succession of the vertebrate assemblages shows interesting shifts associated to environmental and palaeogeographical changes that occurred during the Cenomanian and the Turonian. The compound Kem Kem beds assemblage represents a mixture of terrestrial and mostly freshwater taxa, with possibly some brackish components. The Ifezouane Fm, in which most of this assemblage is found, corresponds to fluvial plains and deltas. The Aoufous Fm may have been deposited in lagoons and paralic sebkhas. Several taxa of the compound Kem Kem beds have very large distribution areas, extending from Egypt (east) to northeastern Brazil (west). This feature indicates the occurrence of a relatively homogeneous ecosystem spreading over huge areas on North Africa, which was not crossed by the trans-Saharan seaway at that time, and extending to the northern part of South America, although this continent was already separated from Africa by the incipient South Atlantic. The environment of deposition of the Agoult assemblage was a shallow, restricted and still marine environment. The palaeobiogeographic affinities of the fishes of this assemblage are mainly with the Central Tethys (North Morocco, Italy, Slovenia, Lebanon), indicating that the transgression reached that region from the northeast, but also with the assemblage of Vallecillo in Mexico via the central Atlantic. The Goulmima assemblage was deposited in a deeper marine environment, and the abundance of buliminid foraminifers in the sediment may correspond to a bloom that provoked the death and the preservation of the animals. The biogeographical affinities of the vertebrates (fish and reptiles) show some connections with South America, but especially with the western extremity of the Tethys (Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico) and even with the Western Interior Seaway in North America.

Among the Potamotrygoninae subfamily and in addition to the middle Eocene Potamotrygon ucayalensis found in oldest levels, three new fossil species of Potamotrygon, namely P. contamanensis nov. sp., P. canaanorum nov. sp., and P. rajachloeae nov. sp. are described from late Oligocene-late Miocene deposits along the Quebrada Cachiyacu, near Contamana, Peru. These new fossils fill a substantial gap in the sporadic fossil record of this exclusive freshwater elasmobranch subfamily, native to South America, thereby highlighting their ancient biological and ecological diversity. In the absence of sharks, the occurrence of obligate freshwater potamotrygonins, along with additional marine to brackish batoids from nine successive fossiliferous levels, supports the predominance of fluvio-lacustrine environments in that region throughout the considered period, with a peak of marine influence around the middle-late Miocene transition, as recorded in other areas of Western Amazonia.",Chabain,"Geobios, 50 (5-6): 389-400",Journal article,English,L,,"L_16257, L_16263, L_16264, L_16265, L_16268, L_16272, L_16273, L_16274, L_16277, L_16281, L_16282, L_16283, L_16288, L_16289, L_16290",chabain et al. 2017,Chabain et al. 2017

This Disrupted Zone (DZ) is located in the Maastrichtian Fox Hills Formation about 20 meters above its transitional contact with the Pierre Shale, and ranges from 0.5 to 5 meters in thickness. Based on Sr age dates, sedimentary features, and impact ejecta, we interpret the DZ as a distal manifestation of the end-Cretaceous Chicxulub Impact Event. The DZ occurs in an interval with uncommon, but significant fossil content. Scaphitid ammonites characteristic of the Jeletzkytes nebrascensis ammonite zone occur below and within the DZ, but not above it. In addition, the sections, including the DZ itself, contain nuculid and inoceramid bivalves, osteichthian and chondrichthian remains, crustacean crawling traces, leaf fragments, and disseminated, and sometimes carbonized, plant debris. Compared to earlier late Cretaceous faunas of the Western Interior, the Badlands K/T fauna is impov- erished in that it contains relatively few species. This impoverishment is unrelated to the end-K impact, and is more likely the result of environmental conditions in the Seaway coupled with the high-stress conditions of local environments within which the
Badlands fauna lived.",Chamberlain,"Proceedings of the 6th Fossil Resource Conference: National Park Service Geological Resource Division Technical Report NPS/NRGRD/ GRDTR01/01. p. 27–43 in V. L.

Numerous palaeontologists have studied the fossile fauna of the marine sediments at Turnu Rosu. Ludwig Johann Neugeboren from Sibiu (Hermannstadt) was the first and, in fact, the only one for one hundred years, who studied the fauna of fossil sharks. In 1850, Neugeboren published the first and up to now only systematic work on shark fossil fauna in Romania. The fauna list presented here is preliminary. A complete list of the fauna of fossil sharks will be published aller the study of the enti re collection of the Natural History Museum and further screening of the collected sediments for the identification of the microfauna. The list published here contains 20 new species for the Tumu Ro~u area and 17 new species for Romania. The shark fauna at Tumu Ro~u has been partially described and published (CIOBANU 1994, 1995, 1996). We consider the publishing ofthis fauna list - the first after almost 143 years - as necessary for total and global fauna correlations. The comparative analysis of eocene selachian fauna with that from northem Africa (Maroc, Tunisie, Egypt), and the northem and central European basins demonstrated the predominace ofthe mediterranean fauna type.

Associated lithic (mainly quarzite) tools, and the predominant exploitation of the Lama guanicoe relate the ancient inhabitants of the site with those of the early-middle Holocene sites of the Area Interserrana of the Provincia de Buenos Aires. According to the stratigraphic context and the terrestrial fauna, the age of the deposit seems to be constrained to the early-middle Holocene. The root tips of the shark teeth are marked by an artificial transvers groove fitted to tie a thread. Tooth edge serrations are strongly eroded, suggesting they were used as tools. We favour the hypotheses that the fish could have stranded on the beach or a small estuary in the neighbourhood, or that the teeth were obtained from the body of a pinniped attacked by a shark and sobsequenty found by humans.

Calcareous nanno-plankton analyses of the sediment embedding the pristid remains, coupled with biostratigraphic data from literature, allowed us to bracket the time of deposition between 3.61 Ma and 3.19 Ma. To our knowledge, the rostral spines described herein represent the first record of Anoxypristis in Italy; as such, they expand our knowledge on the late Neogene central Mediterranean biodiversity. Moreover, our finding represents the geologically youngest occurrence of Anoxypristis in the Mediterranean basin and evokes palaeoenvironmental conditions favourable to the persistence of tropical/subtropical taxa along the Pliocene coasts of Tuscany. The definitive disappearance of Anoxypristis from the Mediterranean could be attributed to the severe climate degradation which accompanied the onset of long-term Northern Hemisphere glaciation around 3 Ma.",Collareta,"Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie, Abhandlungen, 284 (3): 289-297",Journal article,English,L,L_152,L_21902,collareta et al. 2017b,Collareta et al. 2017b

Porbeagle sharks inhabit a broad variety of mid- and high-latitude coastal and open-ocean environments, ranging across the northern Atlantic Ocean and in a continuous band in the Southern Hemisphere. We report on a fossil tooth, identified as belonging to Lamna nasus, discovered in late Pliocene (i. e., Piacenzian) upper bathyal mudstones exposed at Castelnuovo Berardenga Scalo (Siena Basin, Tuscany, Italy), a site which has also provided a well- diversified deep-water elasmobranch assemblage rich in forms such as Chlamydoselachus lawleyiand Centrophorus granulosus. To our knowledge, this specimen represents the first fossil record of L. nasus in the Mediterranean Basin; as such, it expands our knowledge on the late Pliocene central Mediterranean biodiversity and contributes to the still fragmentary fossil history of the genus Lamna. Our finding suggests that, at least at times, seawater temperatures suitable for cold-temperate coastal-pelagic organisms were present along the coasts of Tuscany during deposition of the mudstones exposed at Castelnuovo Berardenga Scalo. Since these deposits are believed to postdate the so-called Mid Piacenzian Warm Period (3.264-3.025 Ma), the occurrence of a tooth L. nasus could be regarded as an early marker of the long-lasting cooling trend which affected the Mediterranean waters starting from around 3 Ma. The porbeagle shark, therefore, might have been one of the earliest Atlantic cold-water fish taxa to enter the Mediterranean realm in Plio-Pleistocene times.",Collareta,"Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie, Abhandlungen, 287 (3): 307-316",Journal article,English,L,L_153,L_21942,collareta et al. 2018,Collareta et al. 2018

Moghra, on the northern rim of the Qattara Depression, preserves early Miocene (18- 17 Ma) fluvio-marine sediments with fossils of wood, invertebrates and vertebrates. The Moghra site is faunally similar to the Libyan Gebel Zelten site, at least in terms of the fossil mammals. The fossil-bearing localities in the Moghra Formation number about 40 and span a distance of about 50 km. There is likely more than one depositional environment represented. The fish previously reported from Moghra include two teleosts, Synodontis (Mochokidae) and Lates (Latidae), as well as the elasmobranchs, Pristis (Pristidae), Myliobatis (Myliobatidae) and Sphyrna (Sphyrnidae). Several more recent expeditions to the Moghra localities recovered abundant selachian remains. This rich assemblage included species from the genera Carcharias (Odontaspididae), Megaselachus (Otodontidae), Cosmopolitodus (Lamnidae), Hemipristis (Hemigaleidae), Galeocerdo and Carcharhinus (Carcharhinidae), Myliobatis (Myliobatidae), Pteromylaeus (Myliobatidae) and Aetobatis (Myliobatidae).

These include 12 elasmobranchs, two chimaeroids, five actinopterygians, and three reptiles. All but three taxa are described and illustrated for the first time for the formation. One species is new, Dasyatis concavifoveus. Teeth of Carcharias taurus are most frequently found; other vertebrate fossils are relatively uncommon or rare. Cannonball vertebrates are known from 72 localities, most from southwest-central North Dakota.

The marine fishes suggest a temperate Cannonball Sea of primarily shallow subtidal depths. Surprisingly, osteichthyan diversity is much lower than that of chondrichthyans, likely because of taphonomic factors. The marine fishes confirm a Paleocene, more specifically Thanetian, age for the Cannonball Formation. The Danian-Thanetian boundary, however, may occur within the Cannonball Formation because other fossil evidence implies a Danian age. Of the 15 marine Cannonball fishes identified to species, 13 are known from western Europe, seven from Maryland and Virginia, and five from western Greenland. These occurrences imply a connection of the Cannonball Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. These fishes, with the possible exception of Otodus obliquus, are only known from Paleocene or younger strata, supporting proposed K-T boundary marine fish extinctions and Paleocene fish renewals.",Cvancara,"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 13 (1): 1–23 ,6 fig.",Journal article,English,L,"L_3269, L_3270, L_3271, L_3272, L_3273, L_3274, L_3275, L_3276, L_3277, L_3278, L_3279, L_3280, L_3281, L_3282, L_3283, L_3284, L_3285, L_3286, L_3287, L_3288, L_3289, L_3290, L_3291, L_3292, L_3293, L_3294, L_3295, L_3296, L_3297, L_3298, L_3299, L_3300, L_3301, L_3302, L_3303, L_3304, L_3305, L_3306, L_3307, L_3308, L_3309, L_3310, L_3311, L_3312, L_3313, L_3314, L_3315","L_6439, L_644, L_6440, L_6441, L_6445, L_6455, L_6456, L_6457, L_6458, L_6460, L_6461, L_6462, L_6463, L_6466, L_6469, L_6471, L_6473, L_6474, L_6475, L_6476, L_6477, L_6478, L_648, L_6480, L_6485, L_649, L_6490, L_6492, L_6495, L_6498, L_6499, L_65, L_650, L_6500, L_6501, L_6503, L_6436, L_6435, L_6438, L_6437, L_6448, L_6432, L_6444, L_6449, L_646, L_6484, L_6497, L_6508, L_6509, L_6426, L_6429, L_643, L_6430, L_6431, L_6427, L_6447, L_6459, L_6465, L_6468, L_6472, L_6479, L_6482, L_6491, L_6494, L_6496, L_6504, L_6505, L_6506, L_6507, L_6434, L_6442, L_6446, L_6464, L_6467, L_6481, L_6493, L_6443, L_6483, L_6433",cvancara & hoganson 1993,Cvancara & Hoganson 1993
"Da Silva, C.M.",2007,,"Os vertebrados da Bacia da Paraíba: Cretáceo Superior-Paleoceno, Nordeste do Brasil.",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,,"The aim pourpose of this research is the study of the vertebrate fauna of Paraíba Basin, using taxonomic, paleoecologic and paleoenvironment aspects with emphasis in the tooth analysis of reptiles and bone fishes (Enchodus), for the diagnostic characteristics that allow the taxonomic classification. It was indentified and revised taxonomic of 36 taxon, from field works, bibliographical surveys and UFPE and UFRPE paleontological collections. The vertebrates are represented by two classes of fish and reptiles; there are the dominance of fishes. The Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) are four species of rays and twelve species of sharks, distributed in eight genus, with the occurrence of Ptychodus designated for the first time for the basin. The Osteichthyes (bone fishes) with ten taxon, the most common are Enchodus and pycnodontiforms. The reptiles of the basin are marine and terrestrial. The marine group are the Mosasauridae family, with two subfamilies, Mosasaurinae and Plioplatecarpinae, and the genus Mosasaurus, Globidens, Platecarpus and Prognathodon; superorder Crocodylomorpha, Dyrosauridae family; Plesiosauria order, families Elasmosauridae and Pliosauridae. The terrestrial ones are represented by the orders Testudines (Pelomedusidae family) and Pterosauria, with Nyctosaurus lamegoi species. The coprolites analysis had been attributed to the chelonia and crocodylomorphs. Beyond the importance in the identification of taxon, the teeth had been analyzed to infer alimentary habit of the groups and possible environmental interpretation. The types of diets found are: clutching (sharks); crushing/grinding(rays); grasp/crush/chop (large predator); pierce/gouge (sharks) and; slicing/gouge (sharks). The microanalysis of teeth for MEV-EDS shows the preservation of the original biomineralization through the identification of elements that compose the hidroxylapatite mineral, beyond possible presence of the element Iridium in tooth of Mosasaurus anceps, from the Gramame Formation. The vertebrates of the basin suggest deeper marine environment of external shelf for the Itamaracá and Gramame formations and shalow marine environment in the Maria Farinha Formation.

The oldest records of the group occur in upper Cretaceous deposits, and one extinct species, Apocopodon sericeus, is found in the Danian (lower Paleocene) Maria Farinha Formation of the Paraíba Basin, Pernambuco state, northeastern Brazil. This taxon is known from isolated teeth and several partial dentitions in various states of completeness, and herein we describe a new, incomplete (lingual portion) Brazilian dental plate. Previously considered to be endemic to the Paraíba Basin, Apocopodon was recently identiﬁ ed from South Carolina, United States. The sample consists of a nearly complete upper(?) dentition and numerous isolated teeth, and the material is indistinguishable from A. sericeus. The precise stratigraphic position and age of the South Carolina fossils is unknown, but based on the other associated Paleocene vertebrate fossils, we believe that the fossils originated from the Danian Rhems Formation. The South Carolina occurrence of Apocopodon represents a signiﬁ cant geographic range extension of more than 7,000 km to the north of the type area, and the occurrence of this ray in such widely separated areas demonstrates the dispersion potential of fossil elasmobranch species. Analysis of the new specimens, along with reanalysis of all previously known Apocopodon dentitions maintained in Brazilian institutions, resulted in a revision of the morphological characteristics used to identify the taxon.

The precise stratigraphic origin of these teeth could not be established, but the taphonomic condition strongly suggests a Late Miocene or Early Pliocene age, although reworking from older Miocene strata cannot be excluded. These teeth are remarkable for the presence of serrated cutting edges of both upper and lower teeth as well as their large size. The teeth, that measure up to 1 cm, are the largest fossil Centrophorus reported in literature. The subtle differences between the teeth of different Centrophorus species and the paucity of comparative extant material prohibit specific attribution, but the teeth pertain to individuals that equalled the largest extant species.

This specimen, that consists of a set of teeth, pieces of calcified cartilage, and placoid scales, represents the first associated cardabiodontid material from North America. The combination of direct observation and radiographic examination reveals that the specimen contains at least 78 teeth, including presumed functional and replacement teeth. The teeth vary in size and morphology, suggesting that the dentition of the shark showed heterodonty. The tooth set includes teeth referable to ‘upper intermediate teeth’ in which their presence is characteristic of the order Lamniformes. This shark individual is estimated to have measured at least 2.5 m and as much as 3.8 m in total length.

"Dicroce, T. & Digby, C. & Johnson, B. & Kinneer, B. & Young, B.",1998,,"The Late Cretaceous fauna of the Denver basin, Colorado, USA",Fifty-Eight Annual Meeting. Society of Vertebrate Paleontology,,"The Denver Basin is a Late Mesozoic-Tertiary down warped structure formed by
the Laramide Orogeny 75-20 Mya. The basin extends 560 km north-south, and
420 km. east-west from the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Along its axis near the
Front Range the basin is filled with sediments to a depth of ~3,960 m. During
the latest Cretaceous (upper Maastrichtian) two nonmarine vertebrate bearing for-
mations were deposited, the Laramie Formation and the overlying lower portion
of the Denver Formation; both are equivalent to the Lance Formation of Wyoming.
These formations were laid down on a widening coastal plain following the retreat of the eperic seaway to the east. Since O. C. Marsh's initial report of dinosaurs
from the Denver Formation in 1896, over 200 additional fossils have been cata-
loged. Our renewed investigations have revealed over a dozen new sites uncovered
mostly during housing construction. To date, specimens collected include eleven
families of dinosaurs (42% of specimens), two families of mammals (5%), seven
families of non dinosaurian reptiles (30%), three families of amphibians (7%),
four families of bony fish (10%), and five families of rays and sharks (5%) (1%
indet.). The recent discovery of a Pachycephalosaurus skullcap represents the
southernmost range extension of this animal. The numerical dominance of Tri-
ceratops among the dinosaur specimens is at odds with the hadrosaur dominated
Lance Formation of Wyoming, and is more similar to the Triceratops dominated

"Diedrich, C.G.",2014,,Skeleton of the Fossil Shark Isurus denticulatus from the Turonian (Late Cretaceous) of Germany—Ecological Coevolution with Prey of Mackerel Sharks.,Paleontology Journal,10.1155/2014/934235,"An Isurus denticulatus (Glickman, 1957) shark skeleton from the late Turonian (Late Cretaceous) of Germany is described within a diverse upwelling influenced fish fauna of northern Germany, Europe. It was found in the turbiditic marly limestones at the submarine Northwestphalian Lippe Swell in the southern Proto-North Sea Basin. Compared to modern mackerel shark Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque, 1809, including cranial denticles, this allows a revision of the younger synonym “Cretoxyrhina Glickman, 1964”. Within the Cretaceous Isurus, a loss of the lateral tooth cusps and nutritive clefts of the roots (considered as plesiomorphic character of the Lamnidae) took place from the Albian (Early Cretaceous) to the Campanian (Late Cretaceous). The tooth morphology changed during the Albian-Turonian from a tearing (I. denticulatus) to a cutting (I. mantelli) type (Coniacian-Campanian). The complete lateral cusplet and symphyseal teeth reduction in Isurus at the end of the Cretaceous seem to be a result of the coevolutionary changing feeding habits of a worldwide expanding shark. In a second evolutionary adaptation, parallel to the new radiation of marine mammals (Paleocene/early Eocene), from Isurus, the white shark ancestors (Carcharodon) seem to originate. In another radiation from Isurus, coevolving with appearance of dolphins and further marine mammal evolution within the Middle Miocene, a second time Isurus developed serrated teeth (I. escheri).",Diedrich,"Paleontology Journal, 2014: ID 934235",Journal article,English,L,L_2797,"L_4474, L_4476, L_4473, L_4475",diedrich 2014,Diedrich 2014

The conglomerate beds comprise carbonatic, glauconitic and phosphate nodules, as well as Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous extraclasts. The Burgsteinfurt Formation conglomerates contain fining-upwards parasequences 2–20 cm in thickness, interpreted as tempestite layers within a unit formed by larger-scale Milankovitch Cycles. The presence of the inoceramid Sphenoceramus patootensis and belemnite Gonioteuthis granulata indicate a late Santonian age for the unit. The studied vertebrate fauna from the Weiner Esch locality consists of 20 selachian species (14 macroselachians and 6 microselachians), a few teleosts, rare marine mosasaur remains, and one tooth from a theropod dinosaur. 95% of the vertebrates in the assemblage are depositionally autochthonous, with the remaining material reworked from older underlying Cenomanian–Coniacian (lower Upper Cretaceous) limestones. On the basis of observed sedimentary structures, the scarcity of deep-sea selachians, and the dominance of the Mitsukurinidae (59% of the preserved shark fauna) in the fossil assemblage, the unit is interpreted as a shallow (0–3 metres deep), subtidal, nearshore environment, or even subaerial carbonate-sand islands, located on the southern margin of a submarine swell. The presence of a Santonian theropod in this deposit, and other dinosaur records in northern Germany, together support the interpretation of a short-lived uplift event with strong upwelling influence for the Northwestphalian-Lippe submarine swell north of the Rhenish Massif in the southern Proto- North Sea Basin. A new migration model for dinosaurs moving along carbonate coasts or intertidal zones of shallow carbonate-sand islands in Central Europe is presented, which may explain the scattered distribution of dinosaur remains across Europe in the Upper Cretaceous.",Diedrich,"Open Geosciences, 7 (1): 342–361",Journal article,English,L,"L_2798, L_2799, L_2800, L_2801, L_2802, L_2803, L_2804, L_2805, L_2806, L_2807","L_4477, L_4478, L_4479, L_448, L_4480, L_4481, L_4482, L_4505, L_4506, L_4507, L_4508, L_4509, L_451, L_4510, L_4511, L_4512, L_4513, L_4514, L_4515, L_4516, L_4518, L_4517",diedrich & scheer 2015,Diedrich & Scheer 2015

Glauconious green sands yield an association of typically thanetian taxa: Megasqualus orpiensis, Palaeogaleus vincenti, Palaeohypotodus rutoti. The other two associations, coming from the Argiles et Lignites du Soissonnais, dated as Lower Ypresian, resume the majority of taxa found in the Thanetian, except for two, Notidanodoncf. brotzeniand Rhinobatoidea indet. The most plausible hypothesis is the reworking of Thanetian fauna in the Argiles et Lignites du Soissonnais. The majority of the organisms that composes the clays and lignites corresponds to a facies deposited in continental conditions. Conversely, no taxon of this continental environment has been found in the marine Thanetian deposit. The Argiles et Lignites du Soissonnais of Le Quesnoy were thus not deposited in a paralic domain.

The fauna spans the Cenomanian into Santonian (and possibly the early Campanian). Among the taxa of ishes, the fauna includes four elasmobranch, one rhinobatoid, two neopterygian, two teleost, and one dipnoan. The lissamphibians are quite diverse and include anurans (at least 1 taxon), urodeles (at least 6 taxa), and albanerpetontids (at least 1 taxon). The squamates are of surprising low diversity, represented by only three taxa. Theropod dinosaurs are present including two taxa of dromaeosaurs, two taxa of coelurosaurs, and an unknown taxon. Among ornithiscians, an ankylosaur, an ornithopod, and possibly a ceratopsian are present. Sixteen mammalian taxa including multituberculates, marsupials, a spalacotheriid, and a symmetrodont are present. This is a relatively high diversity fauna from a small sample suggesting that the upland fauna was not greatly different from those recovered from adjacent plateaus (Markagunt, Paunsaugunt, and Kaiparowits) to the east.

Many of these teeth had formerly been assigned to the extinct Late Cretaceous shark Cretalamna appendiculata (Agassiz, 1843), a taxon that is now considered largely restricted to the Turonian of Europe. Recent studies have shed light on the diversity of Late Cretaceous Cretalamna (s.s.) taxa, and here we recognize a new species from Alabama, Cretalamna bryanti. The teeth of C. bryanti sp. nov. appear aligned with the members of the Cretalamna borealis species group, but can be distinguished from these other species by a combination of the following: anterior teeth with a more pronounced and triangular lingual root protuberance, broader triangular cusp, and a taller root relative to the height of the crown; anteriorly situated lateroposterior teeth have a distally inclined or hooked main cusp and more than one pair of lateral cusplets; and lateroposterior teeth have a strong distally hooked main cusp and a root that is largely symmetrical in basal view. At present, C. bryanti sp. nov. is stratigraphically confined to the Santonian/Campanian Dicarinella asymetrica Sigal, 1952 and Globotruncanita elevata Brotzen, 1934 Planktonic Foraminiferal Zones within the Tombigbee Sand Member of the Eutaw Formation and Mooreville Chalk, and teeth have been collected from only four counties in central and western Alabama.

Both cutting edges show evidence of heavy serrations though they are preserved well only at the distal notch. Portions of the enamel are missing and the broken edges are worn smooth. There are two likely sources for the fossil shark tooth of this study.

This feature is thought to have been secondarily lost, as an adaptation to durophagy in batoids. The monophyletic Myliobatiformes are an ecologically diverse clade of batoids that includes very specialized taxa such as the filter-feeding mobulids and the durophagous myliobatids. Their diversity and recent evolutionary history (Palaeogene) make them an ideal model for assessing adaptive constraints that influence enameloid microstructure. This first study focusing only on batoid enameloid shows a very reduced single-layered enameloid in the derived filter feeders. However, most other taxa show a double-layered enameloid, which is probably plesiomorphic for batoids. It is concluded that the triple-layered enameloid is not a synapomorphy of the neoselachii as a whole, but of Selachimorpha only, and that diet specialization in derived myliobatoids indeeds impact their enameloid microctructure, which is confirmed by their fossil diversity.

Among fossil marine vertebrate remains, chondrichthyans seemingly were dominant elements in the Eocene Antarctic fish fauna. The fossiliferous sediments on Seymour Island are from the La Meseta Formation, which was originally divided into seven stratigraphical levels, TELMs 1–7 (acronym for Tertiary Eocene La Meseta) ranging from the upper Ypresian (early Eocene) to the late Priabonian (late Eocene). Bulk sampling of unconsolidated sediments from TELMs 5 and 6, which are Ypresian (early Eocene) and Lutetian (middle Eocene) in age, respectively, yielded very rich and diverse chondrichthyan assemblages including over 40 teeth of carpet sharks representing two new taxa, Notoramphoscyllium woodwardi gen. et sp. nov. and Ceolometlaouia pannucae gen. et sp. nov. Two additional teeth from TELM 5 represent two different taxa that cannot be assigned to any specific taxon and thus are left in open nomenclature. The new material not only increases the diversity of Eocene Antarctic selachian faunas but also allows two previous orectolobiform records to be re-evaluated. Accordingly, Stegostoma cf. faciatum is synonymized with Notoramphoscyllium woodwardi gen. et sp. nov., whereas Pseudoginglymostoma cf. brevicaudatum represents a nomen dubium. The two new taxa, and probably the additional two unidentified taxa, are interpreted as permanent residents, which most likely were endemic to Antarctic waters during the Eocene and adapted to shallow and estuarine environments.",Engelbrecht,"Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 15 (12): 969-990",Journal article,English,L,L_1238,"L_1255, L_1256, L_1257, L_1265, L_1266, L_1267, L_1281, L_1282",engelbrecht et al. 2017a,Engelbrecht et al. 2017a

"Fieman, D.M.",2016,,"Comparing body size of the sand tiger shark Striatolamia macrota from Eocene localities in the Eureka Sound Formation, Banks Island, northern Canada, and the Tuscahoma Formation, Meridian, Mississippi.",University of Colorado,,"As the most abundant vertebrate fossil in the geologic record, shark teeth have the potential to provide remarkable insight into the past. Sharks are in the class Chondrichthyes and possess cartilaginous skeletons which have a low fossilization potential and decompose quickly (Hamm and Shimada, 2002; Cappetta, 2012). The teeth, on the other hand, are highly mineralized and have an added layer of enameloid that, in turn, make them exceptionally preservable (Cappetta, 2012). Analyzing a shark tooth can not only give insight into the fauna living in oceans, but give understanding of the paleoenvironment, such as salinity or temperature. Among the most abundant fossil shark teeth found during the early to middle Eocene Epoch (55-50 Ma) belong to Striatolamia macrota. In the order of Lamniformes (Berg, 1958), Striatolamia belongs to the family Odontaspididae (Müller and Henle, 1839). Striatolamia macrota became extinct during the Miocene Epoch (25-15 Ma), however their closest relatives today are that of the sand tiger shark Carcharias (Cappetta, 2012). On northern Banks Island, in the Northwest Territories, Canada, an abundant amount of fossil shark teeth was found in the Cyclic Member of the Eureka Sound Formation, most of which belong to Striatolamia macrota. Placed during the early-middle Eocene (50-55 Ma), the sharks thrived in a brackish, warm-water environment that was adjacent to a lush rainforest inhabited by a variety of vertebrate animals. A coeval fossil locality in Meridian, Mississippi, known as the Red Hot Truck Stop, also contained a vast amount of shark teeth, most being Striatolamia macrota. Considered a hot, deltaic environment where many different fish and mammals prospered, this was a warmer environment in the early Eocene than today. As is evident, these two localities are of comparable age and paleoenvironment. During the early-middle Eocene, the latitudinal temperature gradient was quite shallow (Fricke and Wing, 2 2004), so the paleotemperatures of Banks Island and Mississippi were not nearly as different as they are today. The fossil shark teeth found in both localities were discovered in fine-grained, unconsolidated sand in formations that consisted of cycles of sand, silt, and lignite indicating a nearshore, deltaic environment. If the environments are similar, then one would predict the same species in both localities will also be comparable in size. As stated by Cappetta (2012) and Shimada (2004), the largest tooth can be a proxy for the body size of the shark. Since the early Eocene localities on Banks Island and Mississippi both have a large amount of Striatolamia macrota teeth, I measured approximately 400 teeth from each locality and compared their sizes in order to determine if they had similar-sized sand tiger sharks during the early Eocene Epoch. Specifically, this paper will talk about whether latitude plays a role in the body size of these sharks because they inhabited a similar nearshore deltaic environment.",Fieman,"Undergraduate Honors Theses.

Its rostrum has many features of †Xiphiorhynchus: composed of paired premaxillae that fuse together distally, an internal canal system with a central canal and two pairs of lateral canals, and a ventral surface covered with villiform teeth. It has the following features previously unknown in †Xiphiorhynchus: lower jaw that is as long the upper and with a fused symphysis, large hyoid apparatus, complete suspensorium, pectoral fins and girdles, dorsal and anal fins, up to eleven articulating vertebrae. We were unable to locate pelvic fins, maxillae, nasals, prenasals, or scales. The neurocranium is unlike others identified as †Xiphiorhynchus with its elongate ethmoid and apparent lack of nasals. In addition, all elements in its pectoral girdle are aligned in the dorso-ventral plane.

Recent discoveries have shown that during this time, some lamniformes reached gigantic sizes (>6-8 m in total length) not seen in earlier species. Given the importance of life history to understand how organisms reach such sizes, we conducted an ontogenetic analysis on three very large shark vertebrae, representing a single individual from the Lower Cretaceous (Albian) Duck Creek Formation of Texas. Using three different techniques (computed tomography, histological sectioning, and surface texture analysis), we were able to show that this individual was born at a relatively small size and subsequently grew at rapid rate, achieving a total length of over 6.3 m in approximately 18 years; a rate not observed in any other Cretaceous species. Comparison of the different aging techniques yielded complementary results; however, surface texture analysis produced the most complete ontogenetic record for this specimen. More work is needed to determine broad patterns in the life history evolution of giant Early Cretaceous lamniform sharks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Frederickson,"Cretaceous Research, 59: 272–277",Journal article,English,L,"L_2827, L_2828","L_4556, L_4557",frederickson et al. 2016,Frederickson et al. 2016

Here, a small elasmobranch assemblage is presented from the Valanginian of Austria that contributes significantly to a better understanding of early Cretaceous elasmobranch diversity. The new assemblage comprises two new carcharhiniform sharks, Altusmirus triquetrus gen. et sp. nov. and Fornicatus austriacus gen. et sp. nov., a new orectolobiform shark, Similiteroscyllium iniquus gen. et sp. nov., and a galeomorph shark tooth of uncertain affinities. The recent identification of Similiteroscyllium gen. nov. has shown that it has strong similarities with Ornatoscyllium rugasimulatum from the Lower Cretaceous of France. Significant differences of the tooth morphology of O. rugasimulatum and the type specimen O. freemani justify full reconsideration of the systematic position of O. rugasimulatum and require it to be reassigned to Similiteroscyllium gen. nov. described in this paper. The new assemblage described here, and those from the Valanginian of France and Poland comprising 30 additional taxa, indicates that Early Cretaceous elasmobranch diversity was significantly higher than previously assumed.

"Fucks, E. & Deschamps, C.M.",2008,,Depósitos continentales cuaternarios en el noroeste de la provincia de Buenos Aires.,Revista de la Asociación Geológica Argentina,,"Quaternary continental deposits in the northeast Buenos Aires province. Geological and paleontological features of the continental units cropping out at this area of the Pampean region are described. These features suggest that the continental (fluvial, eolian and weathering) processes have had a major influence in the development of the different geoforms, lithological units, and fossil components. The continental deposits mostly developed and widely distributed in the area are those composed of loess and loessoid silts grouped as the Pampeano Formation. This mainly eolian unit, has been reworked in some cases by water and gravitational processes, and affected by weathering, and also involves fluvial and lacustrine facies. Because of its homogeneity, its differentiation has been often based on non-lithological aspects, being arbitrary, and making difficult the correlation with other exposures, especially regarding its horizontal discontinuity, and when little thickness is exposed. Consequently, it is considered that the name of Pampeano Formation for all these sediments is more appropriate to reflect the characteristics of the unit. Other units cropping out in the area are also described, such as the La Postrera Formation, the channelled deposits of the Luján Formation and the modern alluvium, the geosols Puesto Callejón Viejo and La Pelada, and the mixed or littoral units of the Pilar and Campana formations.

Here we report on the chondrichthyan fauna from the late Maastrichtian site that yielded the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton FMNH PF 2081 (“SUE”). Significant among the recovered fauna is an unidentified species of carcharhinid shark that adds to the fossil record of this family in the Cretaceous, aligning with estimates from molecular evidence of clade originations. Additionally, a new orectolobiform shark, here named Galagadon nordquistae n. gen. n. sp., is diagnosed on the basis on several autapomorphies from over two-dozen teeth. Common chondrichthyan species found at the “SUE” locality include Lonchidion selachos and Myledaphus pustulosus. Two phylogenetic analyses (Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Inference) based on twelve original dental character traits combined with 136 morphological traits from a prior study of 28 fossil and extant taxa, posited Galagadon n. gen. in two distinct positions: as part of a clade inclusive of the fossil species Cretorectolobus olsoni and Cederstroemia triangulata plus extant orectolobids from the Maximum Parsimony analysis; and as the sister taxon to all extant hemiscyllids from the Bayesian Inference. Model-based biogeographical reconstructions based on both optimal trees suggest rapid island hopping-style dispersal from the Western Pacific to the Western Interior Seaway of North America where Galagadon n. gen. lived. Alternatively, the next preferred model posits a broader, near-global distribution of Orectolobiformes with Galagadon n. gen. dispersing into its geographic position from this large ancestral range.",Gates,"Journal of Paleontology, 93 (3): 512-530 ",Journal article,English,L,L_2832,"L_4579, L_458, L_4580, L_4581",gates et al. 2019,Gates et al. 2019

Although other vertebrate taxa have long been known from the site, this is the first substan- tive investigation documenting the microvertebrate fauna associated with Sue’s remains. The microfauna to date—obtained from screenwashing over six cubic meters of sediment collect- ed during the preparation of the skeleton—consists of several chondrichthyian fishes such
as Lonchidion, Myledaphus, and a possible new species of Chiloschyllium (bamboo shark); osteichthyes including Coriops, amiids, and gar; the amphibians Habrosaurus, Scapherpe- ton, and two albanerpetids. Terrestrial taxa from the site include: Chamops and a varanid among other lizards, four theropod dinosaur tooth morphs, rare champsosaurid and crocodil- ian remains, the turtle Cedrobaena, and one multituberculate mammal. Amphibians are the most common faunal constituent, whereas gar fish remains are relatively rare, a pattern that is in stark contrast to many other Hell Creek Fm sites. The fossils are preserved in muddy sandstone interbedded with muddy siltstone layers preserving abundant leaf fossils, which provides an indication of burial time for the assemblage if the sediment alternation is sea- sonal. Here we propose a new method using macrovertebrate specimens as a time proxy for microvertebrate assemblages buried in the same layer by examining the taphonomic profile of the macrofossils and comparing with accepted degeneration times. The bones of FMNH PR 2081 do not show evidence of weathering, abrasion, or other physical damage associated with long exposure. Using these taphonomic features, we estimate that the microfauna ob- tained from this study likely accumulated in about five years or less. Increase in the precision of accumulation times is an advance from previous methods that could produce wide ranging estimates on the order of tens to hundreds of years. The narrower time span observed here may explain some of the faunal discrepancies compared to other Hell Creek microvertebrate assemblages that are more time-averaged.",Gates,"Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Seventieth Anniversary Meeting, 2010, 94",Abstract,English,L,L_2079,"L_28889, L_2889",gates et al. 2010,Gates et al. 2010

They come from several sites located close to Tinerhir (also spelled Tineghir), in the eastern part of the basin (fig. 1), and from several successive levels (fig. 2) from the Late Paleocene (57 Ma) to the middle Eocene (45-43 Ma). The Ouarzazate basin vertebrate assemblages correspond to taphocoenoses and are characterized by the absence or scarcity of species of middle and large size because of a taphonomic bias resulting from a hydrodynamic sorting of clastic and bioclastic material. They include especially diversified selachians, and among the earliest known squamates and placental mammals discovered in Africa. More than 130 species are identified, including osteichthyans, selachians (59 species), one amphibian, reptiles (17-18 species of chelonians, crocodilians, and squamates) and mammals (43 species). The selachian assemblages from the Ouarzazate basin helped to date the successive fossiliferous levels from the late Paleocene and early Eocene [Cappetta et al., 1997, 1987]. The richest selachian assemblage comes from the Adrar Mgorn 1 site (Thanetian). It includes three significant genera for stratigraphical correlation: Tingaleus, Microbatis and Garabatis. Tingaleus is still known only in the Ouarzazate basin. The Ouarzazate selachian assemblage shows more differences with faunas from northern phosphate basins than with faunas from West Africa [Cappetta et al., 1987]. This supports the paleogeographic reconstruction of a West-East epicontinental gulf isolated from the Ganntour and Ouled Abdoun phosphate basins. The Thanetian local selachian fauna is characterized by the abundance and diversity of the Dasyatidae, and by the presence of several Orectolobiformes. Large pelagic predators such as Lamniformes are scarce. This indicates shallow tropical marine environments. The Ouarzazate basin has yielded the earliest Cenozoic amphibian and terrestrial squamates discovered in Africa; those from the Adrar Mgorn 1 and Ilimzi sites are among the very few known during the Paleocene in the world. The amphibians remain poorly known. The lepidosaurian squamates are well diversified (13-14 species). Lizards are represented by amphisbaenians, gekkonids, and poorly documented indeterminate forms. The amphisbaenian Todrasaurus is unique among lizards in its greatly enlarged teeth. The snakes include several species of madtsoiids, “tropidophiids” (Dunnophis), Coniophis, and one of the earliest known scolecophidians. Paleogene faunas from the Ouarzazate basin have yielded the earliest known African placental mammals along with those of the Ouled Abdoun phosphate basin. Even if only or mostly micromammals are preserved in the Ouarzazate fauna, they display a significant diversity (e.g., Les faunes de vertébrés marins et terrestres du Paléogène du bassin d’Ouarzazate, Maroc 488 ≥ 25 species in the single site of Adrar Mgorn 1) which supports that Africa is one of the main continental centers of evolution involved in the initial radiation of eutherians and placentals. The systematic and phylogenetic position of the mammals from the Ouarzazate basin remains poorly solved because they are poorly preserved and because they belong to generalized insectivore-like eutherians representative of poorly known stem groups. They include generalized eutherians such as Cimolesta and Pantolesta and euarchontan-like forms such as Adapisoriculidae. They also include one of the earliest and most primitive known hyaenodontid « creodont » (Tinerhodon) and also the earliest known euprimate (Altiatlasius). Many of the primitive insectivore-like eutherians from the Ouarzazate basin, such as the cimolestans and the adapisoriculids, show intriguing Laurasian affinities, especially with North American and European taxa. They are evidence of trans-Tethyan dispersal at the beginning of the Paleogene, and more probably of several dispersal events [e.g., Gheerbrant and Rage, 2006]. By contrast, no mammals with clear South American or Gondwanan affinities have been identified. However, Prasad et al. [2009] recently evidenced relationships between the Moroccan adapisoriculids and Deccanolestes from the Maastrichtian of the Deccan inter-Trapps, in India. Mammals from the Ouarzazate basin Paleogene sites also include endemic taxa of African origin such as hyaenodontid “creodonts” (=Hyaenodontida), paenungulates (Proboscidea, Hyracoidea) and possibly insectivore-like afrotherians such as Tenrecoidea questionably identified in Adrar Morgn 1. Some modern groups such as chiropterans are also identified in the Lutetian of the Aznag site. The absence of multituberculates from the Ouarzazate mammal assemblage is noticeable by contrast to Paleocene and early Eocene Laurasian faunas. Multituberculates are however known very early in Africa, in the Berriasian locality of Anoual, Morocco [Sigogneau-Russell, 1991]. On the other hand, marsupials confidently occur in Africa only in the Oligocene (Fayum, Egypt), although tentative Eocene identification is made with Kasserinotherium from Chambi, Tunisia. Because of the marine sedimentary context and of the presence of marine stratigraphic index taxa, the Ouarzazate microvertebrates constitute reference assemblages for biostratigraphic correlation of the terrestrial vertebrate faunas from the Paleogene of Africa. The magnetostratigraphical study of the local Paleocene and Eocene sites and formations [Gheerbrant et al., 1998b] also allows new perspective to intercontinental stratigraphical correlation. This enhances the significance of the Ouarzazate faunal assemblages in the characterization of the early Cenozoic evolution of African faunas. The Paleogene series of the Ouarzazate basin preserves a faunal succession that documents in situ evolution during a significant time range, and most importantly during the world-wide PaleoceneEocene faunal turnover time. In Africa, in situ evolution of terrestrial faunas at Paleocene-Eocene transition is elsewhere recorded only in the Ouled Abdoun basin where continental fossils are much scarcer. Paleocene-Eocene mammal lineages identified in Ouarzazate faunas do not show evidence of significant changes or turnover by contrast to Laurasian evolution. This is also true for the squamate fauna. This is possibly related to more steady climatic conditions and stable tropical environments in Africa, at the South of the Tethys. The climatic warming event (PETM) that characterizes the Paleocene-Eocene boundary [Gingerich, 2006] probably had stronger impacts on northern, i.e. Laurasian faunas. As with regard to the paleoenvironment of the mammalian faunas from the Ouarzazate basin, one hypothesis is that at least some taxa lived in close connection with the coastal mangrove that is identified locally during the Lutetian, based on palynoflora [Fechner, 489 E. Gheerbrant et al. 1988; Mohr and Fechner, 1986; Mohr, 1986], and during Paleocene-Eocene transition, based on aquatic palm Nypa [Herbig and Gregor, 1990].

It was the impetus for several field parties by us between 1997 and 2001 which has allowed this survey of the geological, stratigraphic and paleontological context of Phosphatherium localities. This is the first important paleontological field work dealing with higher vertebrates in the Ouled Abdoun Basin since the work of C. Arambourg. Most of the material of Phosphatherium and other Ouled Abdoun mammals was found by local people searching for fossils for dealing, in an area where the economy is widely dominated by the mining development, in addition to more traditional but very poor agricultural resources. All Phosphatherium remains were found in the northeasternmost quarries of the Ouled Abdoun Basin, from a restricted quarrying area called Grand Daoui (fig. 3). In all Grand Daoui recognized localities (8), the mammals come from the lowermost Eocene level. The stratigraphically re-situated mammalian material was found in a bone-bed of the level called “Intercalaire Couches II/I” which is dated as early(iest) Ypresian on the basis of its relative stratigraphic position and its selachian fauna. At present, the occurrence of several mammal horizons in the “Intercalaire Couches II/I” (and Couche I ?) cannot be excluded, but their age difference seems not significant according to both the associated selachian taxa and the mammalian material, in present data. The bone-bed is very rich in macro-vertebrates. It includes especially large teeth of the shark Otodus obliquus which are the subject of very active research for dealing, and which explains the recent discovery of mammals such as Phosphatherium.",Gheerbrant,"Bulletin de la Société géologique de France, 174 (3): 279–293",Journal article,French,L,"L_1499, L_1500, L_1501","L_218, L_2180, L_21800, L_21801, L_21802, L_21803, L_21804, L_21805, L_21806, L_21807, L_21808, L_21809, L_2181, L_21810, L_21811, L_21819, L_2182, L_21820, L_21821, L_21822, L_21823, L_21824, L_21825, L_21826, L_21827, L_21828, L_21829, L_2183, L_21830",gheerbrant et al. 2003,Gheerbrant et al. 2003

This stratigraphic interval was deposited during a transgressive-regressive cycle of the Greenhorn Cyclothem in the Cretaceous Western Inte- rior Seaway. Marine macrovertebrates collected from the fully marine Tropic Shale in the past decade in and around Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area span the Cenomanian-Turonian stage boundary, and include at least six genera of chondrichthyans (Scapanorhynchus, Squalicorax, Cretoxyrhina, Cretol- amna, at least five species of Ptychodus, and c.f. Ptychotrygon), at least four genera of bony fish (Xiphactinus, Gillicus, and Ichthyodectes and at least one pycnodont), three taxa of turtles (Desmatochelys, Naomichelys, and one or more protostegid), and five taxa of short- neck plesiosaurs (Brachauchenius, Palmulasaurus, Trinacromerum, Eopolycotylus, and c.f. Dolichorhynchops). One dinosaur in the fauna, the therizinosaur Nothronychus graffami,
is a non-marine reptile. Using detailed molluscan biostratigraphy, the Tropic Shale can be precisely correlated with deposits of similar age (Mancos Shale) in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, and with beds on the eastern side of the seaway (Greenhorn Limestone) in Kansas and South Dakota. The fish and shark component of the Tropic fauna recovered to date resembles faunas of the same age in the Mancos Shale and the Greenhorn Limestone, but the reptilian fauna differs in the high diversity of short-neck plesiosaurs, the lack of elasmosaurs and mosasaurs, and the presence of the therizinosaur. The lack of long-neck plesiosaurs and mosasaurs may be a consequence of ecological differences. The therizinosaur occurrence is probably a case of bloat-and-float transport from land at least 100 km to the west. In contrast with the marine invertebrate fauna, the vertebrates do not appear to have suffered an extinc- tion event at the Cenomanian-Turonian stage boundary between 94.2 and 93.5 million years ago from the globally recognized Oceanic Anoxic Event II.",Gillette,"Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Seventieth Anniversary Meeting, 2010, 97",Abstract,English,L,L_2080,"L_28891, L_28892, L_28893, L_28894, L_28895, L_28896",gillette et al. 2010,Gillette et al. 2010

This suggests that the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions required for the development of enameloid during odontogenesis are plesiomorphic in chondrichthyans, and most likely in toothed gnathostomes, and provides phylogenetic support for the homology of chondrichthyan and actinopterygian enameloid. Along the neoselachian stem, we see a crownward progression, possibly modulated by heterochrony, from a monolayer of SCE lacking microstructural differentiation to the complex triple-layered tooth enameloid fabric of neoselachians. Finally, the occurrence of fully-differentiated neoselachian enameloid microstructure (including compression-resistant tangle fibered enameloid and bending-resistant parallel fibered enameloid) in Chlamydoselachus anguineus, a basal Squalean with teeth that are functionally cladodont, is evidence that triple-layered enameloid microstructure was a preadaption to the cutting and gouging function of many neoselachian teeth, and thus may have played an integral role in the Mesozoic radiation of the neoselachian crown group.

From this formation, a rich fossil assemblage has been recovered and includes both marine and terrestrial fossil remains which offered the opportunity to reconstruct both seawater and terrestrial air temperatures at a regional scale during the Burdigalian. For this purpose, two sets of fossil samples representative of the whole assemblage have been selected for each locality. They include teeth and bones of sharks, fish, rays, reptiles and mammals, as well as tests of sea urchins and shells of bivalves. First, we performed rare earth element (REE) analyses of 53 apatite samples from both localities in order to characterize the diagenetic history of the assemblage. We then analysed the oxygen isotope composition of 49 biogenic apatite phosphate samples and 6 biogenic carbonate samples representing both marine and terrestrial organisms. Using published isotopic fractionation equations, both seawater and terrestrial air temperatures were reconstructed. Calculated seawater temperatures using phosphate and carbonate isotopic thermometers are + 23 ± 4 °C and + 25 ± 1 °C respectively for the locality of Mendouillet (Bazas) and + 24 ± 4 °C and + 26 ± 1 °C respectively for the locality of Monbalon-Miron (Marimbault). Calculated terrestrial air temperatures are + 18 ± 2 °C for the locality of Mendouillet and + 17 ± 2 °C for the locality of Monbalon-Miron. These regional temperatures are in good agreement with seawater and terrestrial temperatures calculated for other European localities of contemporaneous periods. These results also fit the global climatic context of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum starting at the end of the Burdigalian. Even though the global climatic conditions were warmer than today during the end of the Burdigalian, calculated continental and seawater thermal gradient at mid-latitude appear to have been comparable to present-day ones.",Goedert,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 481: 14-28",Journal article,English,L,"L_174, L_175","L_27650, L_27651, L_27652, L_27654, L_27655, L_27656, L_27657, L_27658, L_27756, L_27757, L_27758, L_2776, L_27760, L_27761, L_27762, L_27763, L_27653, L_27759",goedert et al. 2017,Goedert et al. 2017

The outcrops are exposed on the Pacific margin, including the area between La Purisima and San Juanico, with two localities San Ramon and El Malbar for the San Gregorio Formation. And The San Juan Member, El Cien Formation in the area between El Aguajito de Castro and La Fortuna del Bajio, with fourteen localities to the NW-W, respectively to the city of La Paz. Both formations are well known because the phosphatic sediments in the middle part of their sections, this have been mined in the locality of San Juan de la Costa (Bay of La Paz). Bearing abundant marine fossils, microfossils as well as invertebrates and vertebrates. The microfossils has been diagnostic for the age of the phosphatic sandstones and conglomerates beds with respect to the Upper Oligocene age. Isotopic dating with Argon-Potassium method in tuffs near of the base of both formations indicate an age between 27 and 25 My. But the tropical Diatom Zone: Rocella vigilans, Planktonic Foram Zone P21 and Calcareous Nannofossil Zone NP24, indicate an early-late Oligocene age (Late Rupelian-early Chattian, 30 to 27 My). The fossil sharks and rays correspond to oral teeth, rostral spines, dermal denticles, vertebrae, gill rakers and caudal stinging spines, they are assigned to generic level and to species when possible. The faunal list include 43 species, 33 sharks and 11 rays or batoids, included in 10 Orders, 27 Families and 38 genera. Consisting in a mixture of species and faunas, demersal neritic and pelagic, besides shallow tropical-temperate and deep cold waters. Comparing recent and fossil species, the dynamic evolution, the extinction pattern and the faunal renewal of the elasmobrachs during the Eocene-Oligocene epochs are analized. This shows the relationships of this organisms with respect to the extinction and radiation event during the epochs mentioned, related to a global change from warm to cold climate conditions, possibly related to oceanographic change associated to drifting continents and plate tectonic, between others.

"González-Rodríguez, K.A. & Espinosa-Arrubarrena, L. & González-Barba, G.",2013,,An overview of the Mexican fossil fish record.,Mesozoic Fishes 5 - Global Diversity and Evolution: 9-34,,"The fossil fish record of Mexico is poorly known despite numerous recent discoveries of new localities that represent different ages and environments. The stimulus for a new era in Mexican paleoichthyology occurred in 1976, with the arrival of Shelton P. APPLEGATE in the country. Before ‚ÄúShelly‚Äôs‚Äù time, the study of fossil fishes was delegated to geologists and paleontologists mostly interested in geological exploration for oil and other resources, not vertebrate paleontology. The diverse geological episodes that occurred in Mexico during millions of years generated a large array of different environments that supported a great diversity of biotas, including fishes. Paleozoic ichthyological records in Mexico are scarce, represented only by three reports of the shark Helicoprion. Early Mesozoic fishes have not yet been discovered, but Late Jurassic deposits contain halecomorphs, pycnodontiforms and ichthyodectiforms. So far, the most abundant records correspond to Cretaceous marine fishes. Some localities such as Tlay√∫a (Puebla), Vallecillo (Nuevo Le√≥n), El Chango (Chiapas), and El Rosario (Coahuila) are Konservat-Lagerst√§tten. Some others were discovered more recently and, although their entire diversity is still unknown, certain families such as Macrosemiidae and Ichthyotringidae have already been reported for the first time in the New World. Mexican Cenozoic records, discovered mainly in the Baja California Peninsula, include abundant marine shark and ray teeth but only a few teleost remains. Freshwater teleost records are almost entirely confined to central Mexico and, according to the known records, they seem to be biased towards the Neogene (following the final episodes of the Sierra Madre Occidental and the formation of the Mexican Volcanic Belt). Study of Mexican fossil fishes will help us to understand the patterns of distribution and the phylogenetic relationships of the groups present in this part of the world, and the collaboration of international paleoichthyologists will increase our knowledge of the fossil fishes of Mexico.

The geological age ranges from the Pliocene to the Upper Pleistocene. 2) Comparing with the teeth of the Recent Carcharodon carcharias, these fossil teeth are identified as two of upper left anterior teeth, one of upper left intermediate tooth, two of lower left lateral teeth and one of lower right lateral tooth. 3) Judging from the size of these fossil teeth, the ancient great white sharks are estimated about 4.5 meter to 5.7 meter in total length based on the study of RANDALL (1973). 4) The origin and evolution of the great white shark will be clear by the following discoveries and the morphological and biostratigraphical studies on many fossil teeth from the Pliocene to Pleistocene strata in the Japanese Islands and other countries in future.",Goto,"Earth Science(Chikyu Kagaku), 38(6): 420–426",Journal article,Japanese,L,"L_332, L_333, L_334, L_335, L_336","L_6795, L_6542, L_6574, L_6638, L_6761",goto et al. 1984,Goto et al. 1984

It documents the shark-cetacean trophic interaction during the Zanclean (5 Ma) at Duinefontein (Koeberg). The damage described on the fragmentary cetacean bones was compared with similar damage observed on fossils from Langebaanweg, a Mio-Pliocene site on the west coast of South Africa, and data present in the literature. This comparison showed that the damage was the result of shark bites. The state of preservation makes it difficult to determine if the shark bite marks were the cause of death or as a result of scavenging. The presence of the bite marks on the bone would, however, indicate some degree of skeletonisation. Bite marks on some cranial fragments would suggest that the cetacean's body was in an inverted position typical of a floating carcass. The preservation of the material suggests that the bones were exposed to wave action resulting in their fragmentation as well as abrasion, polishing and rolling. It also suggests that the cetacean skeletons were exposed for a long time prior to burial. The morphology of the bites suggests that the damage was inflicted by sharks with serrated and unserrated teeth. Shark teeth collected from the deposit include megalodon (Carcharodon megalodon), white (Carcharodon carcharias) as well as mako (Isurus sp. and Cosmopolitodus hastalis) sharks, making these sharks the most likely predators/scavengers.",Govender,"South African Journal of Science, 111 (11-12): 178-184",Journal article,English,L,,"L_12050, L_12051, L_12052, L_12053",govender 2015,Govender 2015

"Gregorova, R.",2003,,The Oligocene shark fauna at the Litenice and Bystrice/Olsi localities of the Carpathian flysh in Moravia (Czech Republic). Abstract.,1st Annual Meeting of the EAVP,," The fossil shark fauna from the Oligocene of the “Menilitic formation “ of Carpathian flysh is less abundant and less typical than teleostean fishes. But its presence significantly complements the fossil assemblage from the palaeoecological and biostratigraphical point of view. At the relatively new localities of Litenčice and Bystřice/Olší nine species were discovered: Chlamydoselachus sp., Heptranchias aff. tenuidens LERICHE, 1938 (Hexanchiformes), Squalus aff. alsaticus (ANDREAE, 1892), Echinorhinus aff. pollerspoecki PFEIL, 1983 (Squaliformes), Mitsukurina sp., Isurus aff. flandricus (LERICHE, 1910), Carcharias cf. acutissima AGASSIZ, 1843), Cetorhinus parvus LERICHE, 1908, Alopias cf.superciliosus (LOWE, 1840) (Lamniformes). Five of them - Clamydoselachus sp., Heptranchias aff. tenuidens, Echinorhinus aff. pollerspoecki, Mitsukurina sp, Isurus aff. flandricus were recorded for the first time in the Oligocene of Moravia. Palaeoecologically the shark fauna corresponds to the palaeoecological conditions of teleostean fishes, that show - by the presence of the lanternfishes (Myctophidae), lightfishes (Gonostomatidae) and hatchetfishes (Sternoptychidae) - the mesopelagical condition of the environment. Except for Cetorhinus parvus, Isurus aff. flandricus and Carcharias cf. acutissima, the other sharks correspond to the pelagic species in midwaters between 200 and 1000 m.

relatives by the presence of tooth enameloid comprising three layers.
Although enameloid microstructure studies were mostly used in the aim
of differentiating supposed basal neoselachians from hybodonts,
differences in the enameloid organization among neoselachians have
been recognized suggesting the potential for use of enameloid
microstructure as a phylogenetic tool within the neoselachian sharks.
The enameloid microstructure of five taxa of neoselachian sharks
belonging to two orders, the Hexanchiformes and Synechodontiformes,
has been studied. The Hexanchiformes are a monophyletic order with
extant representatives, whereas the extinct Synechodontiformes have
been considered as monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic by
different authors. This study has revealed numerous new enameloid
microstructures such as amalgamated crystallites in the internal
units [parallel-bundled enameloid (PBE) and tangled-bundled
enameloid], cavities at the shiny-layered enameloid (SLE)/PBE
boundary, radial furrows in the PBE, as well as different original
organizations at the base of the crown and in the PBE at the level of
the cutting edges. Pachyhexanchus pockrandti (Hexanchiforme) and
Welcommia bodeuri have the most of the features in common and they
share more characters with those of Paraorthacodus sp. and Sphenodus
sp. than with Synechodus sp.",Guinot,"Microscopy Research and Technique, 74 (2): 196–205",Journal article,English,L,"L_2875, L_2876","L_4771, L_4772, L_4773",guinot & cappetta 2011,Guinot & Cappetta 2011

Morphological variation observed in the tooth set confirms the presence of heterodonty in the dentition of this taxon. By comparing the teeth of S. raphiodon with those of the extant mitsukurinid shark (Mitsukurina owstoni), the total body length of the fossil individual is estimated conservatively to be 59 cm.

"Hochstein, J.L.",2005,,Quantification of the extent of diagenesis in biogenic apatite of Cenozoic shark Centra.,University of Florida,,"Diagenesis of bone in the fossil record is pervasive; however, the extent of this process varies with depositional environment. Diagenesis is any chemical or physical change that occurs below 200ºC. This study quantifies the extent of diagenesis in shark vertebral centra through analysis of a suite of physical and chemical properties including crystallinity index, carbonate content, isotopes, and major, minor, and trace elemental concentrations. The sharks used in this study (Family Lamnidae) range in geographic location and geological age from the Cretaceous to Recent. Although shark skeletons are initially cartilaginous, the cartilage of the vertebral centra is replaced with carbonate hydroxyapatite during growth of the individual. Understanding chemical changes to biogenic apatite informs of the extent diagenesis has altered the biological signal preserved in vertebrate bones. Modern lamnid vertebral centra establish a modern analog for comparison to fossil lamnid sharks. Rare earth element (REE) compositions, Δ14C, and δ18O, give indications of timing of when these sharks migrate, changes in their eating habits, changes in water depth, and determination of ontogenic age and growth rates. Fossil shark centra used in this study have undergone diagenesis; therefore how have the processes of diagenesis affected the original signal recorded in these centra? Shale-normalized REE patterns indicate that diagenesis has erased the original signal; however because diagenesis occurred at or near the seawater/sediment interface, a seawater REE signal may still be preserved in lamnid shark centra (related to the time of deposition and location). Therefore, with caution, geochemical data from biogenic apatite of fossil marine vertebrates, such as lamnid sharks, may be used to understand paleoceanography and paleoenvironment. Also, the centra from Otodus obliquus demonstrate that the biological oxygen isotopic signal is not completely erased by diagenesis. Therefore, biological signals and diagenetic signals of fossil lamnid sharks can be utilized to understand paleobiology, paleoclimatology, and paleoceanography.",Hochstein,"PhD Thesis, University of Florida",Thesis,English,L,"L_1475, L_1567, L_1568, L_3367, L_3368","L_22039, L_21518, L_22038, L_30270, L_30269",hochstein 2005,Hochstein 2005

Macroscopic analysis of teeth shows that 54% of the teeth have pronounced attritional wear due to a durophagous diet. A higher percentage of unworn teeth than worn teeth (64% vs 27%) have acid damage due to predation or scavenging. Ultrastructural analysis of whole and sectioned teeth show that the enameloid of the teeth is 100–125 µm thick and is composed of a single crystallite enameloid in which apatite crystallites show no preferred orientation. Orthodentine in the tooth crown is composed of dense material with numerous canals for odontoblast processes which extend nearly to the tooth surface. Dentinal tubules surround odontoblasts most of the way through the enameloid.

Biochronological indicators establish a Maastrichtian age (Jeletzkytes nebracensis zone) for the Timber Lake Member and a Danian/Thanetian age for the Canonball Formation. Both formations contain diverse cartilaginous fish faunas represented primarily by teeth and dental plates. Twenty-two cartilaginous fish species represented by 20 genera in 15 families occur in the Timber Lake Member. Fifteen cartilaginous fish species represented by 13 genera in 10 families were identified from the Cannonball Formation. None of the identified species occur in both rock units, and only four genera (Carcharias, Palaeogaleus, Dasyatis and Ischyodus) were common to both units. None of the Cannonball species range into the Cretacous anywhere and four of the Cannonball genera (Megasqualus, Palaeohypotodus, Otodus, and Hypolophodon) originate in the Paleocene. Eight genera (Hybodus, Squalicorax, Paranomotodon, Archaeotriakis, Pseudohypolophus, Ischyrhiza, Ptychotrygon, and Rhombodus) recovered from the Timber Lake Member do not range into the into the Tertiary. All but four families found in the Timber Lake Member range into the Tertiary and only one family represented in the Cannonball Formation does not range into the Cretaceous. The end Cretaceous extinction event did not drastically affecy cartilaginous fish faunas at the family level. This extinction event did, however, have a major effect on the shallow water Western Interior Seaway cartilaginous fish faunas at the generic and, particularly  the specific, levels. The Cannonball fauna is 35% smaller at the generic level than the Fox Hills with reductions coming from genera of varied ecological niches.

This member is lithologically variable and consists of burrowed, greenish-gray, glauconitic sandstone and mudstone or burrowed, inter- bedded sandstone and mudstone. Iron-oxide staining is usually present. Ichnofossils, most of which are Ophiomorpha, occur throughout the member and are often associated with Crassostrea subtrigonalis. The Breien Member is exposed in isolated ravine, road cut, and butte outcrops in south-central North Dakota. It ranges in thickness from 1.5 m in Emmons County to 8.5 m in Morton County. The Breien interfingers with nonmarine, dinosaur fossil-bearing Hell Creek deposits. Both upper and lower contacts of the Breien Member with nonmarine Hell Creek strata are lithologically variable and conformable. The base of the member is 1.5-9.0 m above the Fox Hills Formation and the top of the member is 46-61 m below the Hell Creek-Fort Union formational contact. Because of lithologic variability at the Breien Member's type locality and elsewhere in its outcrop area, three reference sections are designated to characterize the Breien. Fossils are scarce in the Breien Member but indicate deposition within the Upper Cretaceous Jeletzkytes nebrascensis Zone and a Lancian age. The Breien vertebrate fossil assemblage consists of terrestrial and marine taxa, including fish, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and mammals. Marine chondrichthyan teeth are the most abundant vertebrate fossils. Most of these taxa corroborate a Late Cretaceous age for the member and indicate that the Breien was deposited in relatively shallow water, nearshore, marine environments. This marine chondrichthyan fauna is similar to, but less diverse than, the Maastrichtian Fox Hills Formation fauna and exhibits no similarity to the early Paleocene Cannonball Member fauna. This finding lends support for a major end-Cretaceous extinction of marine chondrichthyan species.",Hoganson,"Geological Society of America, Special Paper, 361: 247–269",Journal article,English,L,"L_2175, L_2176, L_2177, L_2178, L_2179, L_2180, L_2181, L_2182, L_2183, L_2184, L_2185, L_2186, L_2187","L_29245, L_29240, L_29241, L_29242, L_29243, L_29244, L_29246, L_29247, L_29248, L_29249, L_2925, L_29250, L_29251, L_29252, L_29253, L_29254, L_29255, L_29259, L_2926, L_29260, L_29261, L_29262, L_29263, L_29264, L_29265, L_29266",hoganson & murphy 2002,Hoganson & Murphy 2002

Though the tooth does not pierce the vertebral periosteum, the intimate association of the fossils—in which the tooth is wedged below the left prezygapophysis—suggests their preservation together was not mere chance, and the specimen is evidence of Cretoxyrhina biting Pteranodon. It is not possible to infer whether the bite reflects predatory or scavenging behaviour from the preserved material. There are several records of Pteranodon having been consumed by other fish, including other sharks (specifically, the anacoracid Squalicorax kaupi), and multiple records of Cretoxyrhina biting other vertebrates of the Western Interior Seaway, but until now interactions between Cretoxyrhina and Pteranodon have remained elusive.

The records from the actual outcrop are listed. 11 different chondrichthyan taxa can be identified. Significant new records consist of articulated fragments and almost complete skeletons of at least six different shark and ray species. They include a new genus and species of Myliobatidae, with in situ preservation of the oral tooth plates and the tail spine. The selachian species Carcharias gustrowensis (Winkler, 1875), previously considered to be a junior synonym of C. acutissima, was validated (Reinecke et al 2005). Aside of isolated teeth, it is represented by a new record of a disarticulated partial skeleton including embryos in situ, providing early ontogenetic data (Hovestadt & Hovestadt-Euler 2010).Most of the chonrichthyans are related to Recent species which prefer shallow coastal seas with temperate to warm water. The preservation of the skeletons and skeletal fragments indicates a low-energy environment with an almost normal oxygen level at the sea floor —for at least some periods of time— and anoxic conditions in the uppermost bottom layers.

"Iserbyt, A. & De Schutter, P.J.",2012,,"Quantitative analysis of Elasmobranch assemblages from two successive Ypresian (early Eocene) facies at Marke, western Belgium.",Geologica Belgica,,"Temporal patterns in biodiversity are affected largely by changes in environmental conditions. Sea level fluctuations rank amongst the major factors that affect marine biodiversity or community structure on a local or regional scale, as confirmed by numerous case studies relating lithology with fossil assemblages in order to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions. However up to now, few studies quantified selachian and batoid faunas (Elasmobranchii) in such a context. In the present study, we compare elasmobranch teeth from two successive facies of Ypresian (Early Eocene) age, as exposed at the Marke clay pit in the southern part of the Belgian Basin. We present a significant link between the difference in lithology of these levels and elasmobranch community structure. In general, selachians are notably more common in clayey levels, while batoids predominate in sandy levels. Following the principle of uniformitarianism, such a link indicates that the recognised patterns in elasmobranch diversity depend mainly on the preferred sea level and/or habitat requirements by a species or a species group, in analogy to what is seen in modern communities. Additional notes on the palaeoenvironment are presented, as well as a list of 36 elasmobranch taxa from Marke, including a number of new recorded taxa for the Ypresian of Belgium.",Iserbyt,"Geologica Belgica, 15 (3): 146–153",Journal article,English,L,"L_1157, L_1158","L_11721, L_11722, L_11723, L_11724, L_11725, L_11726, L_11727, L_11728, L_11729, L_1173, L_11730, L_11731, L_11732, L_11733, L_11735, L_11736, L_11737, L_11738, L_11739, L_1174, L_11740, L_11741, L_11742, L_11743, L_11744, L_11745, L_11746, L_11747, L_11748, L_11749, L_1175, L_11750, L_11751, L_11752, L_11753, L_11754, L_11755, L_11756, L_11757, L_11758, L_11759, L_1176, L_11760, L_11761, L_11762, L_11764, L_11765, L_11766, L_11767, L_11768, L_11769, L_1177, L_11770, L_11771, L_11772, L_11773, L_11774, L_11775, L_11776, L_11777, L_11778, L_11779, L_1178, L_11780, L_11734, L_11763",iserbyt & de schutter 2012,Iserbyt & de Schutter 2012

These comprise ammonoid, coleoid and nautiloid cephalopods, bivalves, gastropods, tele¬ost fish, neoselachians, chimaeroids and thoracosaurine crocodiles. Special attention was paid to assemblag¬es from subunit IVf-7, between the Berg en Terblijt and Vroenhoven horizons, the former being equated (since 1996) with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/L) boundary. Ammonite survivor species, amongst which scaphitids and baculitids, as well as other typically late Maastrich¬tian molluscs such as trigoniids, neithinine pectinids, the tegulated inoceramid Tenuipteria argentea and echinoids (Leymeriaster maestrichtensis, Hemipneustes striatora¬diatus) are known from lower Paleocene (lower Dani¬an) levels. Work underway concentrates on taxonomic, taphonomic and palaeoecological assessments of bi¬valve and gastropod faunas both from the indurated levels of subunit IVf-7 and from the overlying Geulhem Member. In addition, shark and ray assemblages, as well as chimaeroid faunules, are being written up.

So far, most research on the relationship between shark teeth and feeding ecology and systematics focused on the external tooth morphology only. Although the tooth histology of sharks has been examined since the early 19th century, its functional and systematic implications are still ambiguous. Shark teeth normally consist of either a porous, cellular dentine, osteodentine (in lamniform sharks and some batoids) or a dense layer of orthodentine (known from different sharks). Sharks of the order Carcharhiniformes, comprising ca. 60% of all extant shark species, are known to have orthodont teeth, with a single exception‚Äîthe snaggletooth shark, Hemipristis elongata. High resolution micro-CT images of jaws and teeth from selected carcharhiniform sharks (including extant and fossil snaggletooth sharks) and tooth sections of teeth of Hemipristis, other carcharhiniform and lamniform sharks, have revealed that (1) Hemipristis is indeed the only carcharhiniform shark filling its pulp cavity with osteodentine in addition to orthodentine, (2) the tooth histology of Hemipristis elongata differs from the osteodont histotype, which evolved in lamniform sharks and conversely represents a modified orthodonty, and (3) this modified orthodonty was already present in extinct Hemipristis species but the mineralization sequence has changed over time. Our results clearly show the presence of a third tooth histotype‚Äîthe pseudoosteodont histotype, which is present in Hemipristis. The unique tooth histology of lamniform sharks might provide a phylogenetic signal for this group, but more research is necessary to understand the phylogenetic importance of tooth histology in sharks in general.",Jambura,"PLoS ONE, 13 (8): e0200951",Journal article,English,L,"L_183, L_184","L_28264, L_28285",jambura et al. 2018,Jambura et al. 2018

These include 99 different kinds of ichthyoliths, of which 17 are new. Comparisons are made to ichthyoliths previously known from temporally well-constrained deep-sea cores and are correlated with Cenozoic North American foraminifer zones. Ichthyoliths that indicate stratigraphic intervals are identified and illustrated for future stratigraphic correlation and interpretation of basin sedimentary processes. Some elasmobranch ichthyoliths are identified belonging to the families Lamnidae, Scyliorhinidae, and Rajidae and Superorder Squalomorphii. However, most of the ichthyoliths are not identified using binomial systematics. Instead, seven groups of Tofino Basin ichthyoliths are defined (elasmobranch teeth, elasmobranch dermal denticles, triangular teeth with canals, triangularflanged teeth, triangular flexed teeth, cone teeth, and other ichthyoliths) and a coded utilitarian ichthyolith identification system is used, modified, and digitized to include new Tofino Basin subtypes. By using this coded system, important characteristics of Tofino Basin ichthyoliths are determined, an identification code is generated, and a link is made to a systematic page that includes the description and illustration of each species,form, or subtype. The versatility of electronic publishing allowsfor immediate linkages. Tofino Basin ichthyoliths changed from the Oligocene to the Pleistocene, likely in response to shifting environments following regional tectonic activity and an overall global climate cooling trend. Cretaceous/earlyPaleogene ichthyoliths are chiefly elasmobranch teeth and dermal denticles, whereas late Eocene and Oligocene forms are dominated by canal and flexed teeth, followed by Miocene and Pliocene actinopterygian (teleost) cone teeth.

Abstract.,Geological Society of America,,"In central New Mexico, Turonian selachian fossil assemblages from the stratigraphic interval Semilla Sandstone Member of the Carlile Shale to the Juana Lopez Member of the Mancos Shale are nearly monospecific. These assemblages are dominated by the teeth of Ptychodus whipplei with rare occurrences of Squalicorax sp. and Scapanorhynchus raphidon. The selachian-producing units are interpreted as shoals in deep water. This may indicate that Ptychodus whipplei was a deep water shark that came to these shoals to feed. By comparison, the onshore equivalents of the Semilla through the Juana Lopez interval, which include the Atarque Sandstone Member of the Tres Hermanos Formation, yield a diverse selachian assemblage. Although Wolberg (1985) reported 22 species from the Atarque Sandstone, it only contains 11 of the species that he reported: Scapanorhynchus raphidon, Squalicorax falcatus, Ptychodus whipplei, Ptychodus anonymus, Hybodus sp., Chiloscyllium greeni, Cretodus semiplicatus, Ptychotrygon triangularis, Ischyrhiza avonicola, Pseudohypolophus mcnultyi and Rhinobatos sp. This assemblage is dominated by the teeth of the pelagic sharks Scapanorhynchus raphidon and Squalicorax falcatus, and the benthic ray Pseudohypolophus mcnultyi. Ptychodus whipplei is present, but it is a very small component of the Atarque selachian assemblage.

One was established in the central-northern Molasse Basin largely based on informal lithostratigraphic units without biostratigraphic control. The other concept was developed in the southern basin part and resulted in the distinction of the Lucerne Formation and the St. Gallen Formation based on detailed lithofacies analysis. This study aims at linking both concepts at map scale 1:25,000 for a potentially basin-wide correlation of the existing lithostratigraphic units. Based on lithostratigraphic analyses, mammal biostratigraphy and on the palaeoecological reconstruction of marine selachian faunas throughout the OMM of the central Swiss Plateau, we were able to allocate this part of the OMM into the well-established Lucerne Formation and St. Gallen Formation (Middle-Late Burdigalian, mammal units MN3a to MN4b). We further define two new lithostratigraphic units: The member Safenwil-Muschelsandstein (Lucerne Formation), and the bed Staffelbach-Grobsandstein (St. Gallen Formation). The Safenwil-Muschelsandstein denominates the well-known marker horizon of shell sandstone deposits, rich in fragments of irregular echinoids (scutella sp.), near the top of the Lucerne Formation. The Staffelbach-Grobsandstein represents a coarse-grained, often pebbly sandstone or even a fine-grained conglomerate at the base of the St. Gallen Formation. In the study area, the distinction between the Lucerne Formation and the St. Gallen Formation is best documented in the composition of the remnant marine fauna (especially teeth of selachii). Throughout the Lucerne Formation, the marine fauna is dominated by shallow marine faunal elements. In contrast, the Staffelbach-Grobsandstein reveals for the first time a large number of faunal elements of the open sea, which is interpreted as an indication of the marine transgression of the St. Gallen Formation. Furthermore, we present a unique palaeoecological study on marine faunas (mostly sharks) throughout the entire OMM sequence of the central Swiss Plateau.",Jost,"Swiss Journal of Geosciences, 109 (2): 149-169",Journal article,English,L,"L_232, L_233, L_234, L_235, L_236, L_237, L_238, L_239","L_29875, L_29876, L_29877, L_29909, L_29937, L_29938, L_29939, L_2994, L_29940, L_29941, L_29966, L_29967, L_29968, L_29969, L_2997, L_29970, L_29971, L_29972, L_29973, L_29974, L_29975, L_29976, L_29977, L_29978, L_30004, L_30005, L_30006, L_30007, L_30008, L_30009, L_3001, L_30010, L_30011, L_30012, L_30013, L_30014, L_30015, L_30016, L_30017, L_30018, L_30019, L_3002, L_30020, L_30021, L_30022, L_30023, L_30024, L_30025, L_30026, L_30027, L_30028, L_30029, L_3003, L_30045, L_30046, L_30047, L_30048, L_30049, L_3005, L_30050, L_30051, L_30052, L_30053, L_30054, L_30055, L_30056, L_30057, L_30058, L_30059, L_3006, L_30060, L_30061, L_30062, L_30063, L_30064, L_30065, L_30066, L_30067, L_30068, L_30069, L_3007, L_30070, L_30071, L_30072, L_30073, L_30074, L_30075, L_30076, L_30077, L_30078, L_30079, L_3008, L_30080, L_30092, L_30093, L_30094, L_30095, L_30096, L_30097, L_30098, L_30099, L_301, L_3010, L_30100, L_30101, L_30102, L_30103, L_30104, L_30105, L_30106, L_30107, L_30108, L_30109, L_3011, L_30110, L_30111, L_30112, L_30113, L_30114, L_30115, L_30116, L_30117, L_30118, L_30119, L_3012, L_30120, L_30121, L_30122, L_30123, L_30124, L_30125, L_30126, L_30127, L_30128, L_30139, L_3014, L_30140, L_30141, L_30142, L_30143, L_30144, L_30145, L_30146, L_30147, L_30148, L_30149",jost et al. 2016,Jost et al. 2016

We decided Dental formula and the position of each specimen on the upper and lower jaw bones.We assume that the Dental formula is D=P L9A2A2L9Pm) L6MIL6P.
The upper anterior teeth can be separated into first and second anterior teeth on the basis of the difference in the ridge on the mesial distal face and Size of the root compared with the cusp.
The upper lateral teeth show functional changes in the angle ( ƒÆ ) made by two lines of A and B; (A : the line connecting two points of the apex of the primarycusp and the crown-root junction of the mesial base of the primarycusp, B : the line connecting two points of the apex of the primarycusp and the crown-root junction of the distal base of the crown), and we could divide the upper lateral teeth into nine.
The lower lateral teeth show functional changes in the ratio ( ƒ¿/ƒÀ ) of the length ( ƒ¿ ) from the apex of primarycusp to the end of the mesial base, and the length ( ƒÀ ) from the end of the mesial base to the basal line of the root.We could divide the lower lateral teeth into six.
Nine fossil specimens of median teeth were discovered, from that we found that they have much variation in the crown and monotony form of the root. They are about equal in height and width, sometimes have Centralcusp and the sometimes don't, the sometimes have show symmetry and sometimes have asymmetry.

Nearly complete specimens of Sphenodus were previously unknown from the Cretaceous in the Pacific region, and the Nakagawa specimens are the first to exhibit distinct root morphologies, which allow comparison at the species level. A review of the occurrences of this genus reveals that their distribution concentrates in the mid- to high palaeolatitude regions. This distributional pattern of Sphenodus may represent its preference for colder water and possibly explains the extinction of this genus across the Paleocene—Eocene boundary, when the thermal maximum began.",Kanno,"Paleontological Research, 21 (2): 122-130",Journal article,English,L,L_2839,"L_4628, L_4629, L_463",kanno et al. 2017,Kanno et al. 2017

"Kent, B.W.",2018,,"The Cartilaginous Fishes (Chimaeras, Sharks, and Rays) of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, USA.","The Geology and vertebrate paleontology of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland",,"The Miocene sediments of Calvert Cliffs contain a remarkable fauna of cartilaginous fishes, with a total of 54 species. Of these, there are 3 species of chimaeras (ratfishes), and the remaining 50 are elasmobranchs (39 species of sharks and 12 species of rays). This number of species is slightly larger than the Holocene chondrichthyan fauna of the Middle Atlantic states of 46 species (28 sharks and 18 rays). The sharks of Calvert Cliffs are particularly diverse and contain two complex assemblages, both of which had their evolutionary roots in the Paleogene. One assemblage consists of the newly emerged, largely mesotrophic carcharhiniforms spreading from the tropics into more temperate, middle-latitude habitats of the northwestern Atlantic. The other assemblage represents an essentially simultaneous diversification of gigantic, macrotrophic species, principally among the lamniforms. Included within this assemblage is a previously unnamed giant thresher shark (Lamniformes, Alopiidae) with serrated teeth. Taken as a whole, the Calvert Cliffs chondrichthyan fauna is richer in large, free-ranging macrophagous sharks and large, neritic rays than the Holocene fauna of the Middle Atlantic states.",Kent,"In: The Geology and vertebrate paleontology of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland / edited by Stephen J.

XRD data and Rietveld refinement showed that Great White shark teeth have not experienced any measurable evolutionary structural changes over millions of years. The dentine and enamel sections of the teeth mainly consist of Fluorapatite by 1-3.7 % fluoride from elemental analysis from XPS analysis. Also presence of Fe and Mn transition metals has been detected in some of the specimens by XPS. FTIR results demonstrated carbonate substitution for A and B sites in some of the specimens‚Äô enamel and dentine sections. In addition, a medium strong band evidenced presence of water and hydroxide overlap.

All material is from the Santa Marta Formation (late Coniacian-latest Campanian) of James Ross Island and contributes significantly to our knowledge of synechodontiform diversity and biogeographic patterns. Synechodontiforms are represented by two taxa, Sphenodus and Paraorthacodus. The teeth of the Antarctic Sphenodus species differ from most known species assigned to this genus. However, the imperfect preservation does not allow any specific identification of this Antarctic shark. The size of its teeth indicates that this shark probably measured at least 5 m in total length. A new species, Paraorthacodus antarcticus, is introduced. Paraorthacodus is confined to the Santa Marta Formation (Santonian to early Campanian Lachman Crags and late Campanian to early Maastrichtian Herbert Sound members), whereas Sphenodus occurs in the Herbert Sound Member and the Maastrichtian Lopez de Bertodano Formation. The occurrence of synechodontiform sharks in the James Ross Basin correlates with an interval of enlargement of the trans-equatorial Tethyan seaway within the Coniacian- Maastrichtian interval. The absence of all synechodontiforms in Antarctica after the K/T boundary, conversely, concurs with a drop in surface water temperatures.",Klug,"Mesozoic Fishes 4 - Homology and Phylogeny, 455-467",Conference article,English,L,"L_2166, L_2167","L_2920, L_29200, L_29201",klug et al. 2008,Klug et al. 2008

However, the fossil record of fishes is very sparse and extremely incomplete in the IAA. Here we present a diverse fossil cartilaginous fish fauna from Borneo, found in late Miocene sediments in Brunei Darussalam. This fauna provides the first insight into the types of fishes that existed in the IAA region about 6.5–8 million years ago. The chondrichthyan remains belong to 24 selachian and batoid taxa. The shark fauna is dominated by Carcharhiniformes, comprising three families with at least 12 taxa, most related to modern species: Hemigaleidae (one species), Carcharhinidae (nine) and Sphyrnidae (two). In addition, the teeth of one Lamniformes shark, the extinct giant macro-predator Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon, are present in the fauna. The batoids are dominated by Myliobatiformes from the following families: Dasyatidae (three species), Aetobatidae (one), Myliobatidae (three), Rhinopteridae (one), while three taxa of the order Rhinopristiformes were also recovered: Pristidae (one species), and Rhinidae (two). Such diversity of fossil cartilaginous fish has never before been reported from the tropical region of South-east Asia. The dominance of the carcharhinid sharks and small rays suggests a shallow marine, coastal palaeoenvironment. The presence of the freshwater shark genus Glyphis indicates a nearby fluvial influence. Some species of the ray genera, such as Himantura or Pastinachus, have also been reported from estuaries and fresh water. The lack of some generally common Neogene taxa, such as Odontaspididae, Lamnidae and Alopidae, may be linked to such local factors and the coastal shallow-water environment.",Kocsis,"Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, in press",Journal article,English,L,,"L_17039, L_17040, L_17041, L_17042, L_17043, L_17044, L_17045, L_17046, L_17047, L_17048, L_17049, L_17050, L_17051, L_17052, L_17053, L_17054, L_17055, L_17056, L_17057, L_17058, L_17059, L_17060, L_17061, L_17062, L_17063, L_17064, L_17065, L_17066, L_17067, L_17068",kocsis et al. 2018,Kocsis et al. 2018

From these, the first paleotemperatures were calculated for shallow water Cretaceous Paleotropics. The results were compared to those of fish from other Mediterranean localities and to Late Cretaceous marine reptiles from Israel. δ18O in the fish average 18.0‰ in the Early Cretaceous, 17.8‰ in the Cenomanian, 18.3‰ in the Coniacian, 18.2‰ in the Santonian, 19.4‰ in the Campanian, 20.1‰ in the Maastrichtian and 18.4‰ in the Early Eocene. Such variations suggest a warm Cenomanian-Turonian, cooling towards the end of the Cretaceous, and warming up again in the Eocene.

The deduced temperatures for the Cretaceous range between 20°C and 34°C, which is about 10° higher than Cretaceous water surface temperatures in Northern Europe. Apatite from marine reptile skeletons yields similar δ18O to coexisting fish.

The good agreement between these and previously known paleotemperature data give further credence to the validity of paleotemperatures obtained by isotopic analysis of oxygen in phosphates.

The studied tanathocoenoses were formed at the bottom of a more than 2,000 m deep northern basin of the Tethys, being largely represented by the continental rise and bottoms of its narrow furrows, and - to a lesser degree - the continental slope and slopes of a submarine high. Lateral variability of statististically representative assemblages of tanathocoenoses hosted in thin, isochronous horizons is interpreted as a result of both local changes of ichthyocoenoses and the influence of post-mortem relocation of fishes that mainly dwelled the shelf and upper continental slope. Vertical variability, in turn, is considered as a resulting from changeable conditions of the ecological environment, the input and outflow of taxa whose evolution proceeded in the Indo-Pacific area, and the species extinction. Changeability of ichthyofauna within a ca. 16-m.y.-long interval made it possible to document and formally describe 9 zones and 4 subzones of ichthyofauna of ecostratigraphic character. These zones comprise index, representative and accompanying taxa that belong to different ecological groups. Conceptual models of the origin of ichthyofaunal assemblages of individual zones are presented. It is suggested that the origin of assemblage differentiation resulted from the appearance and disappearance of the oxygen minimum zone in the water column, global and local sea level changes, topography of the basin bottom, as well as final basin infilling by sediments of submarine fans. The described and preserved collection of fossil Carpathian fishes, housed at the Department of Palaeozoology of the University of Wroc¬≥aw, requires further specialized palaeontological studies in order to reconstruct a more complete composition of the Oligocene-Early Miocene ichthyofauna ",Kotlarczyk,"Annales Societatis Geologorum Poloniae, 76: 1-111",Journal article,English,L,"L_241, L_242, L_243, L_244, L_245, L_246, L_247, L_248, L_249, L_250, L_251, L_252, L_253, L_254, L_255, L_256, L_257","L_30204, L_30205, L_3051, L_3068, L_3081, L_3093, L_3126, L_3156, L_3184, L_3379, L_3438, L_3485, L_3510, L_360, L_3645, L_3656, L_3686, L_3708",kotlarczyk et al. 2006,Kotlarczyk et al. 2006

The single specimen consists of a characteristic rostral spine, which was recovered from nodular limestone in the West-Peruvian Trough of the central Andean Basin, close to the city of Cajamarca. The fossil-bearing strata belong to the lower part of the Celendin Formation, which is of middle-late Coniacian age. This specimen is the first Coniacian record of Onchosaurus pharao and constitutes the third known record of this sclerorhynchiform taxon in South America filling previous gaps in the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of this species. A review of the distribution patterns of both species assigned to Onchosaurus reveals that the genus originated in circum-Equatorial, tropical waters and subsequently dispersed along different pathways south- and northwards. Based on its palaeogeographic distribution and the size of the rostral spines, both Onchosaurus spp. are considered large, bottom-dwelling sclerorhynchiforms primarily inhabiting shallow marine, near-coastal environments. The palaeogeographic distribution nevertheless indicates that they were powerful swimmers and able to cross wide, open marine distances. The reason for the disappearance of Onchosaurus in the Campanian remains unknown. In the early Maastrichtian, Dalpiazia seemingly replaced Onchosaurus ecologically. However, we hypothesize that the different histologies of rostral spines of Onchosaurus and Dalpiazia are of minor taxonomic importance. Dalpiazia thus might represent a derived onchosaur rather than a distinct taxon.",Kriwet,"Journal of South American Earth Sciences, 39: 52–58",Journal article,English,L,L_2860,L_4755,kriwet & klug 2012,Kriwet & Klug 2012

Here, we describe a partial skeleton of an extinct lamniform shark consisting of 42 slightly disarticulated teeth, 49 vertebrae, and additional unidentifiable cranial and postcranial remains. The specimen originates from the Miocene micaclay of Groß Pampau (North Germany), which is of late Langenfeldian age (= Serravallian-Tortonian boundary; middle/late Miocene). A total of 13 measurements of each tooth, as well as morphological features, were used to reconstruct the dentition of this specimen and to provide detailed taxonomic information. Additionally, the total body size and age at death were established using methodologies based on vertebral and tooth measurements and vertebral centra growth ring counts, respectively. The specimen undoubtedly represents the most complete individual of Carcharodon (= Isurus) escheri, previously known only from a few isolated teeth. The dental pattern (e.g., marked dignathic and monognathic heterodonty patterns; only slightly labio-lingually compressed upper teeth; upper teeth slender with distally inclined or curved main cusps; massive, hook-like upper intermediate tooth; main cusps with crenulated cutting edges; lateral cusplets in teeth of all ontogenetic stages) clearly separates this shark from all hitherto known Cenozoic and recent lamnids and a new genus, Carcharomodus, consequently is introduced. Carcharomodus escheri gen. nov., comb. nov. is a characteristic element of late early Miocene to the Pliocene Western and Central European fish faunas. All previously identified Pacific occurrences represent a different taxon. We estimate that the specimen had a total body length of about 4 m and that it was older than 10 years and thus might have reached maturity before death, as indicated by all available evidence.",Kriwet,"Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 60 (4): 858–876",Journal article,English,L,L_240,L_30164,kriwet et al. 2015,Kriwet et al. 2015

This study quantifies diagenesis of shark vertebral centra through analysis of a suite of physical and chemical characters including crystallinty index (CI), carbonate content, and elemental concentrations. Although shark skeletons are initially cartilaginous, the soft cartilage of the vertebral centra is replaced with carbonate hydroxyapatite during growth. Nine vertebral centra are analyzed from lamnoid (Lamnoidea) sharks ranging in age from the cretaceous to recent using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The variables CI, carbonate content, rare earth element (REE) concentrations, Ca/P, Ba/Ca, Sr/Ba, (La/Yb)N, (La/Y)N, (La/Yb)N vs. (La/Sm)N, La/Yb, and Ce anomalies elucidate the diagenetic and depositional environments of the seven fossil vertebral centra. The two extant centra demonstrate the initial, unaltered end-member conditions for these variables. Two fossil vertebral centra (Carcharodon megalodon and Isurus hastalis) demonstrate a strong terrestrial influence during diagenesis (distinctive flattening of shale-normalized REE patterns) that masked the seawater signal. Three centra (Carcharodon auriculatus, Carcharodon angustidens, and Creotxyrhina mantelli) have indications of some terrestrial influx evident by some flattening of the REE patterns relative to seawater. The terrestrial influence in these five shark centra (C. megalodon, I. hastalis, C. auriculatus, C. angustidens and C. mantelli) are interpreted to represent a primarily nearshore habitat for these species. In contrast, the two Otodus obliquus centra have REE patterns that represent the original seawater signal and have no indications of terrigenous input. These results indicate that fossil shark vertebral centra have the potential to understand diagenesis and reconstruct paleooceanographic environments.",Labs-Hochstein,"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 70 (19): 4921–4932",Journal article,English,L,L_1530,L_21957,labs hochstein & macfadden 2006,Labs-hochstein & Macfadden 2006

Taxa identified thus far include: the chondrichthyans Cretoxyrhina mantelli, Cretolamna appendiculata, Ptychodus mortoni, Scapanorhynchus texanus, and Squalicorax kaupi; the teleosts Bananogmius, Enchodus, Pachyrhizodus, and Xiphactinus; a toxocheliid turtle; a plesiosaur; two crocodylians; the mosasaurs Platecarpus, Tylosaurus, and Halisaurus; a hadrosaur;and perhaps a small theropod.
The fossils are included within an intergradationalzone between the Tombigbee Member of the Eutaw Formationbelow and the Mooreville Chalk above. Lithologic and invertebrate faunal data suggest this deposit formed as a lag in a nearshore marine environment during a trangressive phase. Evidence also suggests a greater marine influence than is indicated at the Ellisdale Site in New Jersey.

The studied assemblage includes at least 21 species attributed to 10 families and 5 orders: 7 taxa are recorded for the first time in the Pisco Formation and 3 for the first time in the fossil record of Peru. Three shark-tooth bearing intervals have been recognized at Cerro Colorado. Changes in the taxonomic composition of these three fossiliferous deposits allowed us to reconstruct ecological, trophic and environmental dynamics over the stratigraphic succession of Cerro Colorado. In particular, the environmental scenario of the most diversified shark tooth-bearing interval (ST-low1) is consistent with a shallow marine coastal area, influenced by both brackish and open sea waters, dominated by a community of small mesopredator sharks that used this ecospace as reproductive ground (nursery) and recruitment area.",Landini,"Journal of South American Earth Sciences, 73: 168-190",Journal article,English,L,"L_258, L_259, L_260, L_261","L_3764, L_3765, L_3766, L_3767, L_3768, L_3769, L_377, L_3770, L_3771, L_3772, L_3773, L_3774, L_3775, L_3776, L_3777, L_3778, L_3779, L_378, L_3780, L_3781, L_3782, L_381, L_3810, L_3811, L_3812, L_3813, L_3814, L_3828, L_3829, L_383, L_384, L_3840, L_3841",landini et al. 2017,Landini et al. 2017

"Lauginiger, E.M.",1988,,Cretaceous Fossils From The Chesapeake And Delaware Canal: A Guide For Students And Collectors.,"Geological Survey, University of Delaware, Special Publication",,"Fossil collectors have been attracted to Delaware since the late 1820s when the excavation of the Chesapeake and Delaware (C&D) Canal first exposed marine fossils of Cretaceous age (Fig. 1). Since then, many technical and nontechnical works have been written about the fossils. However, there has not been a single source for casual or student collectors to turn to for help in the identification of typical finds. This paper is written to fill that void as well as provide general information about fossils and specific information on geologic formations and collecting localities at the Canal. This report is not designed to be an encyclopedia on the fossils of the Canal but focuses on those fossils found most frequently. The majority of the fossils collected today are from the spoil areas in the vicinity of the Reedy Point Bridge. Thus, the chapter on classification concentrates on the fossils of the Mount Laurel Formation, the stratigraphic unit dredged in that area. Fossils not described in this paper may be identified from other sources listed in the bibliography or by contacting one of the universities or museums that have collections of Cretaceous age fossils from Delaware. The University of Delaware, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Delaware Museum of Natural History, and the New Jersey State Museum are a few of these places. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers museum at Chesapeake City, Maryland, has fossils on display. Rare or unusual finds of fossils should be donated for future study. There is nothing worse than having a ""one of a kind"" fossil spend years in a cardboard box only to be discarded when the collector moves on to other interests.

A refinement of the silver phosphate method was used to isolate phosphate from biogenic materials. Measured δ18O values of 18.6–20.5‰ are interpreted as reflecting high-resolution thermal variations that affected the ocean water column of the western Tethys. The warm (27°C) water masses that characterized Maastrichtian times underwent rapid cooling and stabilized at an average temperature of 19°C during the Dano-Montian and Thanetian. This period of constant and cool temperature was followed by a relatively rapid but more gradual warming to about 25°C achieved in the Middle Ypresian. Significant small shifts in δ18O values between nektonic and benthic fauna recorded only during the stages of rapid warming or cooling may correspond to averaged thermal differences within the water column that developed in response to global climatic changes. The indicated temperature distribution could have been caused by thermal changes in the atmosphere rather than some signal carried by deep ocean currents. The oxygen isotope data coupled with previous measurements of REE and ϵNd(T) on the same samples support the suggestion that paleo-Pacific westward currents progressed as far as the northwestern part of the African platform at the end of the Cretaceous period.,Lecuyer,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 105 (3–4): 235–243, 2 fig.",Journal article,English,L,"L_3044, L_3045, L_3046, L_3047, L_3048, L_3049, L_3050","L_5537, L_5538, L_5539, L_554, L_5540, L_5541, L_5542, L_5543, L_5544, L_5545, L_5546, L_5547, L_5548, L_555, L_5551",lecuyer et al. 1993,Lecuyer et al. 1993

The composition of this fauna is comparable to a certain extent with the late Eocene eastern North Atlantic elasmobranch fauna of the Paris Basin. A comprehensive study of the stratigraphic distribution of the genera and species in the Tarim fish fauna indicates that the fish-bearing Wulagen Formation must include deposits formed mainly in the late Eocene and part of the lower Oligocene, and that the Qimugen Formation is basically early Eocene in age. An ecological explanation of this fish fauna suggests that a warm subtropical shallow Tarim Sea still existed by late Eocene and early Oligocene time. The paleozoogeographic interpretation of the taxa shared by both the Tarim fauna and the Paris Basin fauna also suggests that there might have been a wide communication between the Tarim Sea and the eastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean, or that the Tarim Sea was the east extension of the early eastern North Atlantic.",Li,"Palaeoworld, 7: 107–136, 13 fig., 2 tabl.",Journal article,English,L,"L_1383, L_1384","L_20698, L_20691, L_20692, L_20694, L_20695, L_20696, L_20697, L_20699, L_207, L_2070, L_20700, L_20701, L_20702, L_20704, L_20705, L_20706, L_20707, L_20708, L_20709, L_2071, L_20710, L_20711, L_20712, L_20713",li 1997,Li 1997

Application of the bulk screen-washing method led to the recovery of a rich microvertebrate fauna represented by fish, amphibians, crocodiles, snakes and dinosaurs. In this paper, the ichthyofauna recovered from the new intertrappean section consisting of Igdabatis indicus Prasad and Cappetta, 1993, Lepisosteus indicus Woodward, 1908, Osteoglossidae gen. et sp. indet., Pycnodontidae gen. et sp. indet. and Siluriformes indet. is described. The ichthyofauna dominantly represented by the teeth of Igdabatis indicus is suggestive of a nearshore, deltaic or estuarine palaeoenvironment and Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) age for the intertrappean beds. The remarkable similarity of the new intertrappean fauna to that of Asifabad and the infratrappean beds of Marepalli also is suggestive of coastal-plain conditions all along the Godavari lineament in the Late Cretaceous. Although the presence of planktonic foraminifera in the intertrappean beds of Jhilmili in the Mandla Lobe of Deccan volcanic province has been inferred in terms of a short term marine incursion from the west coast along the Narmada lineament in the Early Palaeocene, currently there is no definitive evidence for the prevalence of marine or coastal-plain conditions along the Narmada lineament at least in the latest Cretaceous.",Lourembam,"Island Arc, 26 (1): 26",Journal article,English,L,L_2870,L_4767,lourembam et al. 2017,Lourembam et al. 2017

The co-occurrence of a selachian assemblage encompassing Potobatis sp., Ouledia sp., and Pristidae indet with the ostracod Protobuntonia sp. and the charophytes Peckichara cf. varians meridionalis, Platychara perlata, and Feistiella cf. gildemeisteri suggests a Paleocene age for the studied deposits (most likely Thanetian but potentially Danian). Fifteen fades have been recognized and have been grouped into three facies assemblages. Facies association A corresponds to the sedimentary filling of a tide-influenced meandering channel formed in the fluvial-tidal transition zone. Facies association B is related to more distal tidal-flats, little channelized tidal inlets and saltmarsh deposits. Facies association C corresponds to a stressed shallow marine environment such as a bay or a lagoon. The delta C-13(TOC) value (- 23.4%) of MD-184 is enriched in C-13 compared to the other samples suggesting the presence of substantial amounts of marine organic matter in MD-184. The delta C-13(TOC) values of samples from other outcrops ( - 27.3 to - 29.8%) indicate a mixed organic matter origin, from terrestrial to brackish environments. The analyzed sediments have similar Nd-Sr isotopic compositions as those of the Cenozoic sediments of the Altiplano (epsilon Nd(0) values from - 6.2 to - 10.7 and Sr-87/Sr-86 compositions from 0.712024 to 0.719026) indicating a similar volcanic source. This multidisciplinary dataset documents the presence of a tide-dominated estuary sourced by the proto-Westem Cordillera debouching into a shallow marine bay during Paleocene times. This transgression might be explained by subsidence created in response to the proto-Western Cordillera loading. Similar to Miocene marine incursions affecting the Pebas megawetland, Paleogene marine incursions in the Amazonian foreland basin associated with Andean uplift may have played a role in the Neotropical biodiversity dynamics in favoring biogeographical isolation and promoting allopatric speciation for terrestrial organisms.

P. Wesselingh),10.1002/9781444306408.ch17,"Direct fossil evidence shows that by the Middle Miocene the freshwater fish fauna of South America, including Amazonia, was essentially modern across a wide taxonomic and ecological range. Much diversification of modern Neotropical fishes occurred during at least the roughly 60 million year period from the Late Cretaceous to the Miocene. Miocene to Holocene Earth history events played little or no role in creating the great diversity of Neotropical fishes at or above the genus level. The record of Neotropical fishes contains almost no documented extinctions of distinct lines of fishes that are phylogenetically close to living groups. There are, however, many cases of Late and post-Miocene local extirpations of modern groups from areas now peripheral to the large, lowlandcis-Andean (Eastern-slope) rivers. The fossil fish assemblages of the Pebas and Acre stages in the Miocene mega-wetland are markedly similar. Further, freshwater fishes of the Middle Miocene La Venta fauna and Late Miocene Urumaco fauna are similar to those of the Miocene mega-wetland assemblages and thus support a high degree of biotic and hydrological relatedness. The majority of Amazonian Neogene fishes were strictly freshwater inhabitants with little or no tolerance for brackish-water conditions. Virtually no Neogene fish fossils from the deep interior of Amazonia, including those of carcharinid sharks, sawfishes, stingrays, ariid catfishes and drums, are certain indicators of marine or even brackish waters.

In a notable exception, shark vertebral centra are secondarily ossified during ontogeny and therefore more prone to fossilization. When they are found in conjunction with taxonomically diagnostic teeth, these centra preserve a record of incremental growth that potentially can be used for macroevolutionary and ontogenetic studies. Consisting of bone (hydroxyapatite mineral phase), however, fossilized centra are prone to diagenesis.

The extent of diagenesis is reported here for associated vertebral centra of the extinct lamnoid shark, Otodus obliquus, from the early Eocene (Ypresian) of Morocco, using gross x-radiographic, and FT-IR techniques. These centra demonstrate significant diagenesis, with the existing secondary mineral consisting of francolite (carbonate fluorapatite). Nevertheless, the physical incremental growth bands consisting of alternating dark-light couplets are preserved in the centra. Carbonate δ18O values across the growth axis of three centra indicate that a proxy signal is archived and interpreted to represent winter/summer seasonal growth for each dark-light couplet band. Given these results, the 19 physical growth bands counted for each of three centra of the same individual represent annuli, i.e., annular growth couplets, and represents a maximum age for this individual when it died. Despite claims to the contrary, pervasive in the literature, once diagenesis is understood, then oxygen isotope analyses of bone carbonate provide important data that can be used to interpret the paleobiology of incremental growth in fossilized vertebrate skeletal tissues. Nevertheless, because diagenesis is present and probably pervasive in fossilized bone, all such incremental studies should use both physical (e.g., x-radiographic and FT-IR) and stable isotopic techniques in order to better understand the paleobiology of extinct vertebrates.

These scarps formed as a result of wave- and current-driven erosion, transport, and redeposition of bottom sediments due to glacioeustactic sea level cyclicity and the migration of the ancestral shoreline since the Pliocene. Fossiliferous lag deposits containing an abundance of lamniform and carcharhiniform teeth, including those belonging to megatoothed sharks, occur adjacent to these scarps. These specimens include teeth from: Alopias grandis, Carcharhinus falciformis, Carcharhinus priscus, Carcharias cf.

Comparison of biostratigraphically significant lamniform and carcharhiniform taxa from the submerged shelf with those from land-based assemblages along the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA indicates that the shallower shelf (‚âà25 m deep) exposes the Miocene Pungo River Formation and intermediate and deeper shelf (‚âà30-35 m deep) expose the Pliocene Yorktown Formation. Many of the Onslow Bay lamniforms and carcharhiniforms also occur in Miocene and Pliocene shallow marine assemblages around the world and reinforce the migratory abilities of these chondrichthyans in the late Cenozoic and the utility of lamniform and carcharhiniform teeth in biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic analyses.",Maisch,"Copeia, 106 (2): 353-374",Journal article,English,L,"L_797, L_798, L_799","PBDB_17576, PBDB_17568, PBDB_17569, PBDB_17570, PBDB_17571, PBDB_17572, PBDB_17573, PBDB_17574, PBDB_17575, PBDB_17577, PBDB_17578, PBDB_17579, PBDB_17580, L_8716, L_8728, L_8704, L_8705, L_8706, L_8707, L_8708, L_8709, L_871, L_8710, L_8711, L_8712, L_8713, L_8714, L_8715, L_8717, L_8718, L_8719, L_872, L_8720, L_8721",maisch et al. 2018,Maisch et al. 2018

Extinct organisms presumably held similar behavioral and coevolutionary characteristics in the past, and were susceptible to the same kinds of natural ecological pressures operating today. Paleoecological investigations are limited by the incompleteness of the fossil record, and particularly by a lack of behavioral data that are so fundamental to ecological studies of living communities and habitats. Opportunities to examine the coevolutionary structure of ancient communities from empirical data are extremely rare. One such opportunity is provided by the Lower Cretaceous Santana Formation of north-eastern Brazil, a series of richly fossiliferous strata approximately 110 million years old. Many fossil fishes from the Santana Formation contain identifiable prey, including decapod crustaceans and fishes. A trophic hierarchy of these organisms is reconstructed here, and their ecological relationships are discussed. Comparison is made with a similar fish fauna from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestone of Germany. Low-level, intermediate and high-level predators are identified in each fauna. Predator-prey relationships in the Santana fauna are strongly hierarchical, and are more focussed at the intermediate predator level than in Solnhofen. Comparison with a model of predator-prey relationships between fishes and benthic fauna of the Baltic Sea (which like the Araripe Basin represents a semi-enclosed environment) suggests that heavy predation on teleosts such asRhacolepis, occupying an intermediate trophic level, may have permitted benthic decapods to proliferate and exclude other benthic organisms. Less intense predation on fishes at the intermediate trophic level would allow their numbers to increase, thereby increasing the intensity of predation on the benthos at the base of the trophic hierarchy.",Maisey,"Environmental Biology of Fishes, 40 (1): 1–22",Journal article,English,L,L_3051,L_5553,maisey 1994,Maisey 1994
"Maisey, J.G.",2000,,Continental break up and the distribution of fishes of Western Gondwana during the Early Cretaceous.,Cretaceous Research,10.1006/cres.1999.0195,"Many Early Cretaceous fishes were endemic to western Gondwana, making their fossils potentially useful tools in biogeographic reconstruction. These occur in a variety of tectonic settings; for example, in rift basins of the East Brazilian Rift System (EBRIS) and corresponding sites in western Africa, in non-rift basins within the EBRIS region, and in interior localities far removed from this area in both Africa and Brazil. Furthermore these occurrences span much of the Early Cretaceous and include syn-rift and post-rift (transitional and marine) deposits. Development of a permanent equatorial seaway in the late Aptian is identified as a crucial event in the biogeographical history of western Gondwana, but several earlier tectonic events are recognized that could have played an important role in pre-drift intercontinental speciation. Different patterns of distribution are noted among non-marine fishes, some taxa occurring within areas of rifting while others are more widespread. The earliest Cretaceous marine fishes in NE Brazil are late Aptian and early Albian endemic circum-Gondwanan taxa. Their arrival coincides with the formation of the equatorial seaway but they occur in strata that were deposited under conditions of anoxia and abnormally high salinity. A more widespread marine invasion (probably from Caribbean Tethys) occurred in the middle and late Albian as oxygen and salinity levels were normalized and surface water exchange began in the equatorial Atlantic.

Both vertebrate fossils were derived from the lower De Grey Formation of the Pierre Shale Group above the Crow Creek Member. The shark tooth was found slightly below the skeleton and so cannot be considered directly associated with the mosasaur; however, hexanchid shark teeth have been found associated with marine reptiles elsewhere. Therefore, the tooth may have been shed during scavenging of the mosasaur carcass. The tooth represents a rare occurrence of a cow shark from the Cretaceous portion of the North American Western Interior Seaway. Because hexanchids normally prefer deeper water, the occurrence is somewhat surprising in the middle of the former seaway in the shallow marine waters of the DeGrey Formation, although hexanchids are known to range into shallower waters.",Martin,"Proceedings of the South Dakota Academy of Science, 95: 69–72",Journal article,English,L,L_2873,L_477,martin 2016,Martin 2016

The specimens were derived from the Late Campanian Santa Marta Formation, Early Maastrichtian Snow Hill Island Formation and the Early–Late Maastrichtian López de Bertodano Formation. Sharks, teleosts, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs are represented, but birds and sea turtles are absent from the BAS collections; neornithine birds have been previously reported from the Late Cretaceous deposits of Antarctica. Shark teeth are relatively abundant, but teleosts are seemingly under-represented. Plesiosaurs (Elasmosauridae) are more abundant and complete than mosasaurs, and juveniles of both marine reptile groups are relatively common. The marine lizards, mosasaurs, are taxonomically diverse as elsewhere in the world, but with relatively few individuals compared to the plesiosaurs, which are taxonomically limited. Aconverse relationship normally occurs at other lower latitude Late Cretaceous localities.

S. schaubi, ‚Ä†Paraetmopterus sp., Pristiophorus sp., Scyliorhinus sp. and a cf. Squaliformes indet) of three different orders (Squaliformes, Pristiophoriformes and Carcharhiniformes). In addition, associated macroremains have also been found, including teeth of ‚Ä†Cosmopolitodus hastalis, Isurus sp., Hemipristis serra, Odontaspis sp., Carcharhinus spp. and ‚Ä†Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon. The assemblage contains taxa with disparate environmental preferences including not only neritic and epipelagic sharks but also an important number of meso and bathypelagic representatives. The migration of deep water taxa to shallower waters through submarine canyons/coastal upwelling is proposed as the most plausible cause for explaining the origin of such assemblage. Interestingly, the composition of the deep-water taxa here reported contrast with the chondrichthyans assemblages from the Pliocene and extant Mediterranean communities. This entails a complex biogeographic history, where the Messinian salinity crisis strongly affected the posterior evolution of the Mediterranean ecosystems but some other factors, such us the existence of anoxic events during the Quaternary, could have also played an important role.",Martínez-Pérez,"Historical Biology, 30 (3): 422-432",Journal article,English,L,L_266,"L_3932, L_3933, L_3934, L_3935, L_3936, L_3937, L_3938, L_3939, L_394, L_3940, L_3941, L_3942, L_3943",martinez perez et al. 2018,Martinez-perez et al. 2018

[Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the middle Eocene Miocene marine and continental deposits in central Tunisia (Djebel el Kebar region).],Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France,10.2113/gssgfbull.187.1.11,"The Kasserine area, in central Tunisia, is for a long time considered by many authors as an emerged island (or islets), since the upper Cretaceous until the middle Miocene. In the eighties, continental deposits were described and dated Eocene. At that time, no marine deposit older than middle Miocene were thus known in central Tunisia, and the only Eocene marine strata, were located in periphery of the emerged zone, in phosphatic basins. It is in the area of Djebel el Kebar, which is situated at the eastern edge of the Kasserine region that a detailed study of the Eocene-middle Miocene deposits was carried out. In the studied series, four major unconformities are observed and correlated on the whole of the site. Between these surfaces, three successive sedimentary units are observed from base to top and are composed of limestone, glauconite and clay deposits (unit I), shell beds limestone (unit II), conglomerate, sandstone and silty-clay (unit III).

Paleontological and biostratigraphic results An important fossils locality was discovered in Djebel el Kebar, in glauconitic marine deposits of the first sedimentary unit. Fauna, very rich, contains many marine (shark, ray, sirenian, etc.) and continental forms (rodent, hyracoid and primate). The new dating clearly indicates that the deposits of the lower part of the series are Bartonian in age.

Sedimentological results Thirteen facies were identified and the exceptional conditions of outcrop in Djebel el Kebar have allowed us to map the lateral facies evolution. The sedimentary environments were reconstituted and their succession shows a very shallow water-depth carbonate platform (wave dominated and influenced by storms and tide), passing upward into a sandy fluvial and estuarine environment.

Tectono-sedimentary and sequential evolution A sequence stratigraphic framework was proposed, in which, on both sides of unconformities primarily of tectonic origin, three very partially preserved sequences (> 3 Ma) are compatible with the second order of Vail et al. [1991]. In these sequences, the major part of the studied series is set up in transgressive system tracts and highstand system tracts. The fossil locality then seems to be associated with several episodes with condensation, formed during the transgressive part of the second order cycle.

Conclusions The first, new and important result of this work, is the characterization and dating of marine deposits older than middle-Miocene in Djebel el Kebar, in central Tunisia. The studied area is thus not in the emerged part of the zone of Kasserine during the Eocene. Between Bartonian and lower-Miocene, marine facies, evolve within an environment of very shallow marine carbonated platform. A major event (flexure coupled with eustatic fall in Miocene) would cause a change of depositional profile, the arrival of coarse terrigenous material and the installation of a continental fluvial and estuarine sedimentary environment. Finally the whole of the series records large scale tectono-eustatic changes, responsible of several second order sequences, partially preserved.",Merzeraud,"Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France, 187 (1): 11–25",Journal article,French,L,,"L_16165, L_16166, L_16167, L_16168, L_16169, L_16170, L_16171, L_16172, L_16173, L_16174, L_16175, L_16176, L_16179, L_16180, L_16181, L_16182, L_16183, L_16184, L_16185, L_16186, L_16187, L_16188, L_16189, L_16190, PBDB_16177, PBDB_16178",merzeraud et al. 2016,Merzeraud et al. 2016

Abstract.","Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 26",,"Poster Session II REVISION OF MIOCENE MACKAREL SHARKS (CHONDRICHTHYES, LAMNIFORMES), WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ""ISURUS"" ESCHERI FROM NORTHERN GERMANY MEWIS, Heike, KLUG, Stefanie, Museum of Natural History, Palaeontology, Humboldt- Univerity of Berlin, Berlin, Germany Generally, Cenozoic lamniform sharks are represented by isolated teeth and vertebrae. Articulated skeletal remains are conversely very scarce. In 1989, a partially articulated skeleton of a specimen referable to ""Isurus"" escheri including 42 slightly disarticulated teeth and 49 vertebrae was recovered from Miocene clays during an excavation of whales in GroB Pampau (northern Germany). This specimen proves to be important for reconstructing the relationship of fossil lamniform sharks because it provides morpho-meristic data of the vertebral column and allows us to reconstruct the dentition of this taxon. It is the first and, until now, only time that more than few isolated teeth of this species have been found. Here, we are presenting results of our study of this specimen and other lamniform sharks such as Carcharodon carcharias, ""Carcharodon"" megalodon, ""Isurus"" hastalis, and ""Isurus"" escheri using dental and skeletal characters to create a modified phylogenetic hypothesis of Cenozoic lamniform sharks and to gain a better understanding of the evolution of the modem White Shark. There are two hypotheses on this topic: either ""C."" megalodon or Isurus (e.g., ""I."" hastalis) was the predecessor. Isurus is generally abandoned now after reintroducingt he name Cosmopolitodus.T here is genetic and now also fossil evidence that the mako and great white lineages must be separated. But even if Cosmopolitodus is accepted to be valid, the taxonomic identity of species such as ""I."" planus and ""I."" escheri remains ambiguous. In addition, the processes responsible for the evolution of ""big"" lamniforms in the Miocene are analysed and compared with that of teleosts and whales to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the size increase in these sharks ",Mewis,"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 26 (Supplement to Number 3): 99A",Abstract,English,L,L_748,L_8349,mewis & klug 2006,Mewis & Klug 2006

The specimen comprises portions of the neurocanium, splanchnocranium, pectoral girdle, vertebrae, numerous teeth and about 12 000 dermal denticles, but no dorsal fin spines. Its dental morphology is unique in combining relatively smooth crown surfaces in anterior teeth, a strongly reticulated ornamentation in latero-posterior teeth and an intermediate ornamentation in larger antero-lateral teeth. The differential diagnoses of three nominal species of Synechodus Woodward, 1888 that have often been recorded from Albian strata (i.e., S. dubrisiensis (Mackie, 1863), S. nitidus Woodward, 1911 and S. tenuis Woodward, 1889) were based mainly on tooth ornamentation. This observation would favour the conspecificity of these three forms, as has been suggested previously by several authors. However, it does not rule out the possibility of more than one species of Synechodus in the Albian of the Anglo-Paris Basin. Such divergent ornamentation might be characteristic of more than one species, meaning that differentiation would be more complex. Awaiting a thorough revision of these taxa, a review of their taxonomic history is presented here. For the time being, the specimen from the Boulonnais is left in open nomenclature and referred to as Synechodus sp.",Mollen,"Geodiversitas, 40 (25): 557-574",Journal article,English,L,L_2041,L_28700,mollen & hovestadt 2018,Mollen & Hovestadt 2018

The chondrocranium is re-identified as that of an angel shark (Squatinidae), based on comparative anatomy of extant Squatina, inclusive of CT scans of Squatina africana, S. australis, S. dumeril, S. guggenheim and S. squatina, with different geographic distributions and representing all four angel shark clades as defined in a previous molecular study. Differential characters for chondrocrania listed in earlier accounts to discriminate angel shark species from the southwest Atlantic proved to be even more revealing when comparing angel sharks from different regions/clades. Despite this wide interspecific variation, the fossil chondrocranium compares well with modern Squatina, but differs in having a UUU-shaped ventral margin of the occipital region and rounded margins of the upper postorbital processes. The distal expansion of the upper postorbital processes present in modern species has not yet been observed in extinct squatinoids and might constitute a derived character for modern representatives only. Angel shark teeth and vertebrae are well known from the same basal deposit at the SVK clay pit, but Cenozoic squatinid taxonomy remains problematic. It is here discussed in detail for the Oligocene taxa S. angeloides, S. rupeliensis and S. beyrichi. For the time being, all SVK material is left in open nomenclature and referred to as Squatina sp.",Mollen,"Contributions to Zoology, 85 (2) 147–171",Journal article,English,L,,L_12789,mollen et al. 2016,Mollen et al. 2016

Although several authors previously described various taxa from the same locality, little was known about their stratigraphic distribution. Present work includes a detailed systematic study, based on numerous specimens along with the establishment of regional stratigraphy and depositional environment. Five new species of sharks are reported here. Among them Isurus desori, Carcharhinus aff. balochenisis and Carcharhinus aff. perseus are described for the first time from the Indian subcontinent; whereas Isurus oxyrinchus and Galeocerdo cuvieri were not previously reported from Baripada. The state-of-the-art of the Miocene shark assemblages of the world has been reevaluated in the light of new data. The most diverse shark teeth assemblage has been found to be in Baripada. Diversity patterns have been studied.

Based on a large number (several thousands) of shark's teeth and teleost otoliths, 19 taxa of Chondrichthyes and 57 taxa of Teleostei could be observed. Six species of Teleostei are introduced here as new: ""genus Percoideorum"" glimmerodensis n. sp., ""genus äff. Lateolabrax"" ruscheli n. sp., ""genus äff. Xenistius"" kasselensis n. sp., ""genus aff. Brachydeuterus"" grossei n. sp., Dentex chatticus n. sp., and ""genus Labridarum"" huckriedein. sp.. The ichthyofauna of the ""Kasseler Meeressand"" consists of typical littoral-neritic assoziations. In this assoziations species of moderatly warmer seas are frequently present. A climate of a warm-temperate (Mediterranian) character has been assumed for the investigated part of the Chattian (middle to upper Eochattian) of the southern North Sea Basin. In the faunal assoziations of several North Hessian localities some remarkable differences occur, interprated here as result of local biotop changes in the former shallow coastal sea.

"Müller, A.",2011,,Der Steinbruch Mammendorf NW Magdeburg - ein Felslitoral der unteroligozänen Nordsee.,Geologica Saxonica,,"In the Mammendorf quarry NW of Magdeburg an early Oligocene rocky shore environment has been exposed. h e famous situation has been used for the i rst investigation of an early Oligocene rocky shore environment in the southern North Sea. As a result of the paleontological work a very rich fauna has been discovered comprising corals (ca. 8 taxa), numerous bryozoans (not investigated), brachiopods (8 taxa), molluscs (225 taxa, Polyplacophora: 2, Gastropoda: 156, Scaphopoda: 1, and Bivalvia: 66, Crustaceans, echinids und i shes (28 taxa). Two transgression cycles have been observed in the rocky shore system. Numerous warm preferent molluscs with Latdori an background characterize the i rst cycle (faunal complex 1) giving that unit a Latdori an aspect. h e general character of the i rst faunal complex is situated between typical Latdori an faunas and typical Rupelian faunas, and is interpreted here as being of late Latdori an age (= late Tongrian in Belgium). Parts of the „Magdeburg Green Sands“ (nannoplankton zone NP22 sensu Köthe, 1990) may belong to the same time span. h e second faunal complex contains typical early Rupelian taxa. h is complex represents an early phase of the Rupelian transgression (lower NP23) and has been correlated with the Berg Sands of Belgium. Due to the singular exposed rocky shore environment both faunas of the Mammendorf quarry are very dif erent to the faunas of the Septaria Clay in northern Germany, and elswhere in the southern North Sea Basin. Much more ai nities to the faunas of the Mainz Basin (lower Oligocene marine sands) could be observed. Numerous molluscs hitherto known only from the Mainz Basin, have been recorded for the i rst time. h us, the faunal relationships between Mainz Basin and southern North Sea were much more intensive as recorded hitherto.

"Müller, A.",2014,,Die Neoselachier der höheren Oberkreide (Campanium) des Münsterlandes. Eine Übersicht.,Geologie und Paläontologie in Westfalen,,"Schon in der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wurde die westfälische Oberkreide, vor allem die des engeren Münsterlandes, durch hervorragend erhaltene Fossilien weltweit bekannt. Vor allem die oft hervorragend konservierten Fische aus dem „Obersenon“ damaligen Verständnisses (heute Campanium) sind bis heute in ihrer Vollständigkeit einzigartig für Mitteleuropa. Die monografischen Bearbeitungen von von der MARCK (1858, 1863, 1873, 1885, 1894) und von der MARCK & SCHLÜTER (1868) haben dieser Fülle schon frühzeitig zu einiger Aufmerksamkeit in der Fachwelt verholfen. Vor allem die Fundorte Sendenhorst und Baumberge lieferten seinerzeit den Hauptteil der fossilen Fische (beides oberes Campanium). Nach der umfassenden Bearbeitung im 19. Jahrhundert regte sich über Jahrzehnte nicht mehr viel zum Thema Oberkreidefische des Münsterlandes. In den kleinen Brüchen bei Sendenhorst kam der Kalksteinabbau bald zum Erliegen – damit ergaben sich kaum noch weitere Chancen auf Nachfolgefunde. Auch in den Baumbergen wurden die Funde weniger, obwohl dort eigentlich fast immer ein Abbau des „Baumberger Sandsteins“ in mehr oder weniger großem Umfang stattfand. Das Material ist aber wohl oft in die Hände von Privatsammlern gelangt. Das trifft sicher auch für aktuelle Funde zu. Erst SIEGFRIED(1954) hat sich wieder mit den Fischen beschäftigt, aber dafür das museale Material verwendet und keine Neuaufsammlungen durchgeführt. Über isolierte, mikromorphe Selachierzähnen ist von SIEGFRIED nichts erwähnt worden, aber etwas später äußerte sich GIERS (1958 u. 1964) zu Massenvorkommen von Fischzähnchen im Campan des östlichen Münsterlandes, ohne jedoch den Versuch zu unternehmen, solche Zähnchen zu bestimmen. Überhaupt hat man ja in Europa erst recht spät mit der Erforschung mikromorpher Selachierzähne begonnen, z.B. um Aachen (ALBERS & WEILER 1964), Belgien (HERMAN, 1977) und Norddeutschland (HERMAN, 1982). Im Münsterland wurden die Ergebnisse erster umfangreicher Aufsammlungen von MÜLLER & SCHÖLLMANN (1989) und MÜLLER (1989) publiziert. Dabei ist eine erstaunliche Diversität ermittelt worden, darunter etliche neue Taxa. Insbesondere squaliforme Hai erwiesen sich als dominante, bisher weitgehend unbekannte Gruppe in diesen Fossilgemeinschaften und Anreicherungen disperser, mikromorpher Zähne. Die Arbeiten von HERMAN, MÜLLER, MÜLLER & SCHÖLLMANN sowie THIES & MÜLLER (1993: Höver im Raum Hannover) mögen anregend für andere gewesen sein, sich ebenfalls mikromorphen Selachierzähnen zuzuwenden, denn bald erschienen vermehrt Publikationen zu diesem Thema: SIVERSON (1993, südliches Schweden) und UNDERWOOD et al. (1999: nordöstliches England). Vom LWL-Museum für Naturkunde wurde ein Projekt zur paläontologischen Bearbeitung von Selachierfaunen finanziell unterstützt.

Abstract.",New Mexico Geological Society,,"Late Cretaceous selachians provide a marine biostratigraphy throughout the North American Western Interior. Here, we report a selachian assemblage from the Bridge Creek Member of the Mancos Shale near the town of Carthage in Socorro County, New Mexico (sec. 8, T05S, R02E). The selachian fossils are in a 0.3-0.6 m-thick bed of sandy limestone/calcarenite at the top of the Bridge Creek Member that yields numerous shells of the bivalves Ostrea beloiti and Mytiloides mytiloides. This fossil assemblage occurs within the Sciponoceras gracile ammonite zone. Specimens of Ptychodus dominate the assemblage, with rare and fragmentary remains of bladeshaped shark teeth, some of which can be identified as Squalicorax sp. Ptychodus specimens belong to P. occidentalis and P. anonymus and further confirm their presence in Upper Cenomanian strata. The P. occidentalis specimens are characterized by their overall square shape and their transverse ridges bifurcating numerous times distally, grading into finer and finer parallel to subparallel ridges. The P. anonymus specimens are characterized by their transverse ridges that extend down the cusps then divide and curl around as they enter the marginal area. In addition, numerous P. anonymus specimens have a prominent cusp that superficially resembles P. whipplei, though the presence of transverse ridges that extend down the sides of the cusp confirm these specimens pertain to P. anonymus. The lithology of the site indicates deposition in deep-water, which suggests that Ptychodus had a preference for deep water, as previously noted by other workers.

In contrast to the Eocene formations of the Fayum, the Oligocene Jbel Qatrani Formation has been more or less consistently considered to be deposited in a freshwater environment; however, the ichthyofauna indicates a more complex picture. Cenozoic fishes have been convincingly used to interpret the palaeoenvironment in which sediments were deposited. Based on the elasmobranch and osteichthyan faunas of the Jbel Qatrani Formation, we interpret that this formation was not deposited entirely in fresh waters, but had some marine influence, particularly in the lower part of the formation. The mixture of freshwater elements, such as polypterids and alestids, with brackish and marine elements, including myliobatid stingrays, in the Quarry E site suggests a local palaeoenvironment that was very close to the shoreline, in a less protected area, or under more seasonal influence than the rest of the sites in the formation.

The prevalence of competitive interactions and species replacements in the fossil record has long been investigated and many evolutionary perspectives, including those of Darwin, have emphasized the importance of competitive interactions that ultimately lead one species to replace another. However, evidence for such phenomena in the fossil record is not always manifest. Here we use new quantitative analytical techniques based on Geographical Information Systems and PaleoGIS tectonic reconstructions to consider this issue in greater detail. The abundant, well-preserved fossil marine vertebrates of the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of North America provide the component data for this study. Statistical analysis of distributional and range size changes in taxa confirms earlier ideas that the relative frequency of competitive replacement in the fossil record is limited to non-existent. It appears that typically, environmental gradients played the primary role in determining species distributions, with competitive interactions playing a more minor role.

Their teeth are generally rare and skeletal elements are less common. The centra of Cardabiodon ricki can be distinguished from those of other lamniforms by their unique combination of characteristics: medium length, round articulating outline with a very thick corpus calcareum, a corpus calcareum with a laterally flat rim, robust radial lamellae, thick radial lamellae that occur in low density, concentric lamellae absent, small circular or subovate pores concentrated next to each corpus calcareum, and papillose circular ridges on the surface of the corpus calcareum. The large diameter and robustness of the centra of two examined specimens suggest that Cardabiodon was large, had a rigid vertebral column, and was a fast swimmer. The sectioned corpora calcarea show both individuals deposited 13 bands (assumed to represent annual increments) after the birth ring. The identification of the birth ring is supported in the holotype of Cardabiodon ricki as the back-calculated tooth size at age 0 is nearly equal to the size of the smallest known isolated tooth of this species. The birth ring size (5–6.6 mm radial distance [RD]) overlaps with that of Archaeolamna kopingensis (5.4 mm RD) and the range of variation of C. mantelli (6–11.6 mm RD) from the Smoky Hill Chalk, Niobrara Formation. The revised, reconstructed lower jaw dentition of the holotype of C. ricki contains four anterior and 12 lateroposterior files. Total body length is estimated at 5.5 m based on 746 mm lower jaw bite circumference reconstructed from associated teeth of the holotype.",Newbrey,"Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 60 (4): 877–897",Journal article,English,L,"L_2096, L_2097, L_2098, L_2099, L_2100, L_2101, L_2102, L_2103, L_2104","L_28915, L_28916, L_28917, L_28918, L_28930, L_28931, L_28932, L_28933, L_28934",newbrey et al. 2015,Newbrey et al. 2015

"Niedzwiedzki, R. & Kalina, M.",2003,,Late Cretaceous sharks in the Opole Silesia region (SW Poland).,Geologia Sudetica,,"The upper Cretaceous deposits of the Opole Trough contain rare but relatively diverse shark teeth, mainly from ptychodontid sharks (Ptychodus latissimus Agassiz, 1843,Ptychodus polygyrus Agassiz, 1843 and Ptychodus mammillaris Agassiz, 1843), Anacoracidae (Squalicoraxsp.), Mitsukurinidae (Scapanorhynchus raphiodon(Agassiz, 1843)), Alopiidae (Paranomotodon angustidens(Reuss 1845)) and Cretoxyrhinidae. Paranomotodon angustidens has not previously been reported from the Opole Trough. The selachians from the Opole Basin can be divided into two trophic groups: bottomdwelling ptychodontid sharks with a diet consisting of shelly invertebrates, and pelagic Lamniformes, which were active predators feeding on fast-swimming fish and reptiles. The morphology of the teeth, signs of abrasion and the analysis of the invertebrate assemblage from the Opole Cretaceous suggest that the ptychodontids fed on inoceramid bivalves, while the lamniform sharks fed mostly on fish. Lamniformes live in all marine environments, and their remains are numerous in all the lithostratigraphic units of the Upper Cretaceous in the Opole Trough. The teeth of deep-water ptychodontid sharks are only abundant in the middle part of the Middle Turonian sediments. Nearshore shark remains are extremely rare in the Cretaceous deposits of the Opole Trough. This indicates that the Middle Turonian (middleI. lamarckiZone) represents the deepest environment of the Opole Cenomanian and Turonian.

"Nilsson, J.",2003,,"Carcharhiniform sharks from the Limhamn quarry, Skåne",Lunds Universitet,,"The material is collected from two different levels in the Limhamn quarry, Skåne, Sweden. The first sample is from the Limhamn limestone in the quarry’s north-west corner and the second sample is from the Copenhagen limestone the quarry’s south wall. Biostratigraphically the material falls within the NP3 interval (nanoplankton zones in the Paleogene). In this paper shark teeth of the order Carcharhiniformes, including the families Carcharhinidae, Triakidae and Scyliorhinidae are described. The following species are described: Abdounia sp. of the family Carcharhinidae, Palaeogaleus aff. faujasi, Palaeogaleus sp. A, Palaeogaleus sp. B, Galeorhinus sp. and Triakis n. sp. of the family Triakidae and Foumtizia sp. of the family Scyliorhinidae. Abdounia sp. represents one of the earliest records of the genus Abdounia. Foumtizia sp. is one of the earliest records of its genus and is the only described member of Foumtizia from outside Morocco. The species diversity seems to have increased among the carcharhiniforms during the Danian compared with the Maastrichtian in Skåne. This could be the result of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary extinction and a rise in the water temperature. Among recent carharhiniforms the highest species diversity is found in tropical and subtropical oceans. Sharks of the family Carcharhinidae only live in these oceans. The high diversity of Carcharhiniform sharks during the Danian period indicates deposition in a warm sea environment. In a contemporary carcharhiniform fauna from Morocco there are species similar to Abdounia sp., Palaeogaleus sp. A, Triakis n. sp. and Foumtizia sp. An explanation for this is that the difference in water temperatur only seems to have been marginal between these regions.",Nilsson,"Examensarbeten i geologi vid Lunds universitet, 157, 1-21",Thesis,Swedish,L,L_1289,"L_1546, L_1547, L_1548, L_1549, L_155, L_1550",nilsson 2003,Nilsson 2003

As a way to fill this gap in our knowledge, the screenwashing technique was used in 14 samples, stratigraphically controlled and hailing from the B17 mine (CIBRASA S/A), in Capanema. This provided the first collection and description of shark scales. There are 400 specimens, which can be divided into seven morphotypes according to the format and topography found on the dental crown. These morphotypes were found in all levels and they belong to the orders Orectolobiformes, Carcarhiniformes and Lamniformes, that were already described from the Pirabas Formation and confirm the shallow, marine and tropical environment.

This contribution provides new evidence regarding the taxonomy, paleobiogeography and chronostratigraphic distribution of this material. For the first time, a partially articulated dental pavement is presented here. Histological analysis indicates affinities to Rajiformes, while morphologic features reveal affinities to the genus Myledaphus. The differences justify the erection of a new species, Myledaphus araucanus sp. nov. Myledaphus occurs in central Chile, being documented in three localities, with a widespread distribution along the Arauco Basin, ranging the lower Maastrichtian to the upper Maastrichtian, and having a latitudinal range between 33 degrees 21' to 36 degrees 45'S. The presence of this genus in the southeastern Pacific during the Maastrichtian contrasts with the morphologically similar genus Hypolophodon previously documented from the Maastrichtian-Paleocene of the southwestern Atlantic. Such segregation between both oceans of southern South America suggests different biogeographic patterns for the marine fauna, reinforcing previous faunal segregations already observed among marine reptiles.

Carcharias aff. ‘hopei’ (Agassiz), Odontaspis sp., Carcharoides catticus (Philippi), Striatolamia macrota (Agassiz),
Anomotodon sp., Macrorhizodus praecursor (Leriche), Galeorhinus sp., Abdounia sp., Hexanchus sp., Squatina sp.,
Hexanchidae indet., Myliobatis sp., Myliobatoidea indet., and Ischyodus dolloi Leriche. This assemblage has clear ecological
affinities with Eocene Tethyan fauna previously described in the Northern Hemisphere, and also has common
elements with Eocene cartilaginous fishes from Antarctica. Additionally, a paleobotanic study of this unit identified leaf
imprints of Asplenium sp., Pteris sp., Podocarpus sp., and abundant angiosperms including Nothofagus lanceolata Dusén,
N. simplicidens Dusén, N. variabilis Dusén, N. cf. alessandri Espinosa, N. subferruginea (Dusén), Hydrangea sp. and
Phyllites spp. Wood remains of Nothofagoxylon scalariforme Gothan and Araucariaceae cf. Araucarioxylon Kraus were

Retitricolpites sp., Tricolpites sp., Liliacidites sp., Polyporina sp., Nothofagidites cincta Cookson, and Nothofagidites
cranwellae Couper, having affinities with Eocene florae, and being consistent with the age of the fossil fishes. Finally, a
SHRIMP U-Th-Pb analysis of two samples collected from the studied beds provided thirty-eight and sixty zircon grains,
indicating a clear main peak at 36.48±0.47 Ma (MSWD=1.5) and 36,73±0.50 Ma (MSWD=0.65). The integrated results

The grassland includes exposures of the Lincoln Limestone Member of the Greenhorn Limestone (Upper Cretaceous: Middle Cenomanian; ca. 95 Ma). The lowermost portion of this stratigraphic member contains calcarenite beds, that are rich in disarticulated remains of marine vertebrates. Both surface collecting and acid treatment of rocks have yielded a variety of elasmobranch and teleost fossils. The identified elasmobranch taxa include: Ptychodus cf.

The new specimens described herein belong to a species with a Heterodontus francisci type dentition.

"Peng, J.",1997,,"Palaeoecology Of Vertebrate Assemblages From The Upper Cretaceous Judith River Group (Campanian) Of Southeastern Alberta, Canada.",University of Calgary,,"Vertebrate assemblages from the Upper Cretaceous Judith River Group (the Foremost and Oldman formations) in the Milk River area of southeastern Alberta are systematically documented, based on evidence from 19 microfossil localities and 78 identified taxa. These data suggest the presence of at least one previously unidentified taxon, one extinction event, and one immigration event. Testing for repeatability of sampling is discussed in the context of ensuring representative samples. The maximum likelihood method is introduced for testing the taxonomic representativeness. Sedimentological examination of the 19 microsites indicates that 17 are associated with one of two sedimentary facies -inchannel and crevasse splay; similar to the situation in Dinosaur Provincial Park (DPP). A third facies association, shoreface, is recognized for two Foremost sites. The microsites are grouped, using multivariate cluster analysis, on the basis of their taxonomic composition and relative abundance of taxa. Three assemblages are identified. These assemblages are highly congruent with their stratigraphic location, but not with their size profiles or facies associations. Characteristic taxa are summarized for each assemblage, based on the distributional patterns. The upper Foremost assemblage is characterized by 10 taxa restricted to the corresponding unit, with two more occurring in relatively high levels of abundance. The upper Oldman assemblage is distinguishable by two taxa restricted to this unit, with three taxa occurring in relatively high levels of abundance. The lower Oldman represents a hybrid assemblage. Local depositional environmental changes are interpreted as the main contributory factors controlling these distributional patterns of vertebrate assemblages. Based on these distribution patterns, the members of two (inland and coastal) palaeocommunities are identified. The community members generally accord with those previously recognized in DPP, although palaeogeographical differences are evident in patterns of turtle distribution.

Geologically, Laño and the adjacent region are set on the southern limb of the South-Cantabrian Synclinorium (SE Basque-Cantabrian Region, northern Iberian Peninsula). The Laño sites were discovered in 1984; thousands of bones and teeth, including microfossils, have been collected during the prospection in the field and excavation campaigns. The vertebrate remains occur at two different stratigraphic horizons within a continental to shallow marine succession of Late Campanian-Maastrichtian age. The lower horizon contains the Laño 1 and Laño 2 sites, whereas the upper horizon contains the Albaina site. In the Laño sites, three fossiliferous beds (called L1A, L1B and L2) are known within an alluvial system composed mainly of fluvial sands and silts. The sedimentary structures are consistent with channel areas within an extensive braided river system. Based mainly on stratigraphic correlations, the fluvial beds of Laño are regarded as Late Campanian to Early Maastrichtian in age. These deposits have yielded a very diverse vertebrate assemblage, which consists of nearly 40 species, including actinopterygians, lissamphibians, lepidosaurs, turtles, crocodyliforms, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals. Seven genera and ten species have been erected to date in Laño. With reference to the marine vertebrate association of Albaina, it consists of at least 37 species, including sharks and rays, actinopterygians, mosasaurids, and plesiosaurs. Two genera and species of rhinobatoids (family indet.) and two new species of rhinobatids have been erected in Albaina. The fossil association indicates a Late (but not latest) Maastrichtian age. Recently, isolated turtle and dinosaur fossils have been discovered in the sublittoral beds of Albaina. The Laño quarry is one of the most noteworthy Campanian-Maastrichtian vertebrate localities of Europe by its taxonomic diversity, and provides useful information about the composition and affinities of both continental and marine vertebrate faunas from the latest Cretaceous of southwestern Europe.",Pereda-Suberbiola,"Journal of Iberian Geology, 41: 101–124",Journal article,English,L,L_2074,"L_28838, L_28836, L_28837, L_28839, L_2884, L_28841, L_28842, L_28843, L_28844, L_28845, L_28846, L_28847, L_28848, L_28849, L_2885, L_28850, L_28851, L_28852, L_28840",pereda suberbiola et al. 2015,Pereda-suberbiola et al. 2015

Up to that point, no fossils of Isistius or Squatina from Florida were present in the vertebrate paleontology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History, nor had they been listed in any scientific publication. However, public inquiries revealed that the presence of both genera in the Florida fossil record has been known among the amateur paleontology community for well over a decade. Once co-author Marks was made aware that the Isistius teeth represented something novel, more rigorous collecting was conducted to procure more specimens. A total of 94.5 kg of matrix from four gravel deposits within the creek, informally known as Cookiecutter Creek, were screenwashed and picked to produce 186 whole or partial lower teeth of Isistius triangulus and four teeth belonging to Squatina. In addition, a diverse vertebrate fauna was recovered that ranged from Pliocene to Pleistocene in age. Screenwashing of 7.5 kg of matrix from the in situ Pleistocene Caloosahatchee Formation revealed no specimens of Isistius or Squatina, which implies their actual source is the underlying Pliocene Tamiami Formation. The unprecedented occurrence of Isistius triangulus, with such a high density in Cookiecutter Creek relative to other sites in Florida, may indicate that Cookiecutter Creek preserves a unique deep-water facies within the Tamiami Formation. The associated vertebrate fauna includes taxa from marine, brackish, freshwater, and fully terrestrial paleoenvironments; providing evidence of local sea-level fluctuations during the Pliocene to Pleistocene. The temporally mixed accumulation in these gravel deposits inhibits a more accurate reconstruction of these sea-level fluctuations.",Perez,"Bulletin of the Florida Museum of Natural History, 55 (7): 139-155",Journal article,English,L,L_8,"L_8735, L_8736, L_8737, L_8738, L_8739, L_874, L_8740, L_8741, L_8742, L_8743, L_8744, L_8745, L_8746, L_8747, L_8748, L_8749, L_875",perez & marks 2017,Perez & Marks 2017

"Pharisat, A.",1991,,"La Paeoichthyofaune du Rupelien marin de Froidefontaine (Territoire de Belfort): Taxinomie et populations, genese du gisement, implications paleobiogeographiques. ",Annales scientifiques,,"The objectives of this work can be divided in three main research axes :
1. To establish a complete review of the palaeoichtyofauna in the marine rupelian at Froidefontaine (Territoire
de Belfort). This was possible owing to new, very rich, stratigraphically well recorded collections which comprise more
than 11000 well conserved specimens.
2. To review the genesis of the environment which has led to the deposits of fish schists.
3. To study the palaeobiogeographical implications.
1.- Besides two new species (Eophicis froidefontainensis nov.sp., Acanthognathus fredericae nov.sp.) anatomie and
biometric analyses of altogether 34 species (that is more than double of the hitherto known species) have allowed to
better define the global composition of the fauna of Froidefontaine.
The latter is composed of typical sea fishes (= stenohaline fishes).Many species which are particulary
significant from the environmental point of view enhance and complete this definition.
* Aeo/iscus heinrichi and C/upea sardinites, make out statistically 85 to 90 % of the fossil fish fauna,
Aulostomidae and Syngnathidae indicate that there must have been a costal zone of a warm sea.
*The abondance of Percoïdae (Serranus, Properca, Pristigenys, Caranx, Sparus etc ... ) allows to further define
this palaeoenvironment as having a shallow deposit character. However , the presence of Palaeorhynchus, Lepidopus
and a few great specimens of Scombridae engage to differentiate these bathymetrical conclusions to some extend.
* Sparse Selachian complets the feeding chain, amongst them mainly Carcharias acutissima, Carcharias
cuspidata and Physogaleus latus. Cetorhinus parvus, the small horny strips of the latter can be found abundantly in ail
layers and indicate clearly the relation between the waters of the gulf of Montbéliard and the colder waters of the Rhine
trench.
Il.- Autoecological and palaeosynecological analyses drawn from the abundant collections allow it to elucidate more of
the fossil fish schist's formation.
Above the Marnes à Foraminifères , which represent the most marine period (open ocean of a depth that must
have been between 1 OO and 200 meters), the succession of fossilised layers of Froidefontaine can be described as
follows:
* Schistes à Amphisiles : a shallow, warm ocean with food and oxygen in great quantity in the superficial
water layers, allowed the development of an ichtyofauna with some Selachian and mainly Aeo/iscus, Clupea and
Palaeorhynchus. To the contrary, the lower water layers near the sea ground were poorly oxygenated and of high
concentration of hydrogen sulfide. Sedimentation of fine detrital particles has led to the fossilization of the fishes killed
periodically by the frequent mass mortalities (degassing ?).
• Transitory zone from the Schistes à Amphisiles to the Marnes à Mélettes : very similar marine
environment with the same palaeoichtyofauna. The density of population is very high but the individuals are smaller. A
detrital layer of alterated azoic particles of elements from the alpine cretaceous period indicates a change of type of
sedimentation and announces the following layers.
• Marnes à Mélettes : a still shallow, warm sea , which differentiates itself from the previous layers by an
ichtyofauna of much more species. The number of individuals, however is much smaller. The sea ground remains
poorly oxygenated and the traquent mass mortalities decimate very regularly the fish population. The fossilization takes
place in a cairn zone, practically without transport as in the preceding layer.
Continental influences become stronger, the top of the formation with inclusions of plants and insects is not
much different from the following layers, the Marnes à Cyrènes .
* Marnes à Cyrènes : the still not very deep sea of the Marnes à Cyrènes changes gradually to a continental
environment with the character of a lagoon and lake, and achieves the cycle of sedimentation of the gulf of Montbéliard
that begun with the marine episode of the Marnes à Foraminifères.
Ill.- Seen from the palaeobiogeographical angle, the rich lie of palaeoichtyological strates of Froidefontaine corresponds
to the ideal junction point of colder seas in northern direction through the Rhine trench and the warmer eastern sea and
the seas around the area of the Carpatian mountains. The composition of the palaeoichtyofauna, typical sea fishes
(stenohaline) of the marine Rupelian, illutrates clearly this palaeobiogeographical bipolarity.",Pharisat,"Annales scientifiques, Université Franche–Comté, Besançon, Géologie, 4: 13–97",Journal article,French,L,L_1428,"L_21148, L_21149, L_21151, L_21152, L_21153, L_2115, L_21150",pharisat 1991,Pharisat 1991

For example, the diversification within the Gas‐terosteiformes, is almost the same as that described from contemporary localities of the Russian Paleogene. The faunal composition indicates a stenohaline, littoral and subtropical palaeoenvi‐ronment. It is also characterized by its clear palaeobiogeographi‐cal biopolarity: on one hand, there are typical elements of the colder seas (e.g. Cetorhinus paruus) that entered the Upper Rhine‐Valley Rift System from the North; on the other hand, there also are species (e.g., Aeoliscus heinrichi and Aulostomus medius) that clearly represent warmer seas of the SE‐Paratethys.",Pharisat,"Italian Journal of Zoology, 65: 189–191",Journal article,English,L,,"L_12752, L_12753, L_12754, L_12757, L_12758, L_12755, L_12756",pharisat 1998,Pharisat 1998

"Phillips, A.",2008,,"A Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) marine vertebrate-rich bioclastic horizon from the northeastern margin of the Western Interior Seaway, Canada",Carleton University,,"Throughout the Cretaceous Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, concentrations of the remains of fossilized marine vertebrates & invertebrates (macrofossils) occur as dense bioclastic and bonebed horizons. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, these horizons are particularly abundant within the Belle Fourche Member of the Ashville Formation, deposited along the eastern margin of the Cenomanian Western Interior Seaway (WIS). Concentrations of abundant bones, teeth, and scales of marine and, very rarely, terrestrial, vertebrates are found along with bivalve-rich horizons such as the regionally wide-spread Ostrea beloiti layer along the length of the Manitoba Escarpment.
A newly discovered locality near the southern end of the escarpment has yielded calcarenites, composed primarily of inoceramid-derived calcitic prisms and abundant, disarticulated marine vertebrate elements and microcoprolites, as well as oyster valves. Stratigraphically, these deposits are believed to be of early Middle Cenomanian age, originating lower in the Belle Fourche Member than previously described marine vertebrate bonebeds from the region.
The preserved vertebrate fossils reveal a diverse paleocommunity comprised of 12 chondrichthyan taxa, 13 osteichthyan taxa, and 2 reptilian taxa. Several of these, including Protosphyraena sp., Squalicorax falcatus, a salmoniform, Xiphactinus audax, Enchodus cf. E. gladiolus, Enchodus cf. E. petrosus, and Enchodus cf. E. shumardi represent earliest occurrences of these taxa in Canada and/or North America, as well as what may be the earliest evidence of eels (Order Anguilliformes) on this continent.
Taphonomic data indicates that the bioclasts were concentrated by physical processes such as winnowing, as well as by the siliciclastically-starved setting of the eastern margin of the WIS. Evidence of minor transportation, winnowing, and reworking are taken to indicate these bioclastic sediments were initially deposited relatively further offshore than other bonebeds known from the Manitoba Escarpment, at or just beneath storm wave base. Petrographic study of the bonebeds reveals that variability in the amount of inoceramid-derived prismatic calcite buried along with the concentrated vertebrate bioclasts may have affected the timing of cementation, and therefore the susceptibility of these deposits to further reworking.
Comparison with skeletal limestones known from the Greenhorn Limestone in the United States suggests that the calcarenites studied here were deposited in a similar manner: as the result of storms (i.e. as tempestites) impinging on the extremely shallowly sloping sea floor of the eastern margin of the Western Interior Seaway, during one of the frequent oscillations of sea-level during the Cenomanian. Cretaceous marine bioclastic and bonebed horizons are widespread in the WIS and may eventually serve as stratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic markers integrated into a basinwide framework.",Philips,"Thesis, Carleton University",Thesis,English,L,"L_3371, L_3372",,phillips 2008,Phillips 2008

Abstract.",SVP 75th Annual Meeting,,"Elasmobranchs from the Cenomanian Melovatka Formation of the Volga region (Russia) have been known since the mid-19th century and were studied by L. Glickman between 1950 and 1970. Up to now, only one middle- and numerous late Cenomanian elasmobranch assemblages have been recognized. Recent collecting and bulk sampling from a single early Cenomanian locality (Melovatka-5) as well as four middle Cenomanian localities has provided new data on Late Cretaceous elasmobranch distribution and diversity.
The early Cenomanian assemblage is dominated small to mid-sized lamniform sharks (Archaeolamna cf. kopingensis, Eostriatolamia subulata, Palaeonacorax volgensis, Kenolamna gunsoni, Pseudoscapanorhinchus compressidens; each taxon comprising 30% down to 2.5% of all specimens). Less common shark taxa (Paraorthacodus recurvus, Synechodus dubrisiensis, Squatina cranei; taxa comprising 1.5-1% of specimens), rare species (Cretoxyrhina vraconensis, Cretolamna catoxodon, Protolamna sokolovi, ‘Eorhincodon’, Johnlongia, Anomotodon, Polyacrodus, Acrodus, Protosqualus, Heterodontus, Cederstroemia; taxa comprising less than 1% of specimens). Batoids are very rare and restricted to two taxa (Squatirhina, Turoniabatis).
The middle Cenomanian assemblage is similar to that from the early Cenomanian, but shows more ecological differentiation and contains more taxa: Palaeoanacorax obliquus (absent or common at different localities), Ptychodus spp. (absent, very rare or common), Cretoxyrhina denticulata (instead of C. vraconensis), Cardabiodon cf. ricki (very rare), Protoscyliorhinus (rare), ? Carcharias and ? Telodontaspis. Some taxa are totally (Cretoxyrhina vraconensis) or occasionally (Kenolamna gunsoni, Palaeoanacorax obliquus, Protosqualus, Protoscyliorhinus, Squatirhina, Turoniabatis) absent in different localities at this time.
The early-middle Cenomanian elasmobranch communities demonstrate an initial faunal invasion and a trend of increasing diversity resulting from regional marine transgressions which provide locally varied environmental conditions during the middle Cenomanian. Overall, the Cenomanian elasmobranch fauna in the region is a low-energy community occupying the boreal epicontinental sea of the Russian Plate.",Popov,"Conference: SVP 75th Annual Meeting in Dallas, USA",Abstract,English,L,"L_2048, L_2049","L_28721, L_28715, L_28716, L_28717, L_28718, L_28719, L_2872, L_28720, L_28722, L_28723, L_28724, L_28725, L_28726, L_28727, L_28728, L_28729, L_2873, L_28730, L_28731, L_28732, L_28733, L_28735, L_28736, L_28737, L_28738, L_28739, L_2874, L_28740, L_28742, L_28743, L_28734",popov & biriukov 2015,Popov & Biriukov 2015

[in Ukranian with English abstract]",Visnyk of Taras Shevchenko,,"A study into the sections of the Cretaceous deposits at the Southern Kaniv dislocation revealed teeth of fossil Elasmobranchs in thin quartz-glauconitic gravel interlayers. The species composition of the fauna is associated with the Albian-Cenomanian (for a single gravelly interlayer of Kholodniy Yar taphocoenoses) and the Cenomanian (two fossiliferous gravelly interlayers at Melanchin Potik). Along with elasmobranchs, fossiliferous gravel sands contain remains obviously redeposited from the more ancient strata. The probability and scope of redeposition decrease from the Kholodnyi Yar taphocoenosis, through the Melanchin Potik lower layer, to the Melanchin Potik upper layer. The stratigraphic intervals are assumed to be wider for Kholodnyi Yar (the Albian-Cenomanian) and narrower for Melanchin Potik (the Cenomanian). The fossiliferous gravelly interlayers resulted from transgressive-regressive events. With the transgressing sea eroding the previously formed deposits containing fauna and flora remains, the latter were redeposited, sorted and waterworn due to the tidal zone hydrodynamics. The conditions described account for mixed taphcaenoses (those of the Melanchin Potik lower layer and Kholodnyi Yar). Besides, a more powerful rewashing may have affected a previously gravelly interlayer, which is likely for Kholodnyi Yar. The transgressive events seem to have been rather dynamic: deep-water deposits containing no fossils rapidly replaced the litoral and sublitoral ones. The following regressive-transgressive cycle therefore resulted in the formation of unmixed taphocoenoses in the basal horizon. In general, the Cenomanian palaeolandscapes of the study area were more even than the Albian ones. The Albian islands were characterized by a great variety of mesophite flora and physiographic conditions. On the contrary, low flattened shores of the Cenomanian islands did not favour the development of tree vegetation.",Popova,Visnyk of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv–Geology (1): 10–14,Journal article,Ukranian,L,"L_2969, L_2970, L_2971","L_5102, L_5103, L_5104, L_5105, L_5106, L_5107, L_5108, L_5109, L_511, L_5110, L_5111, L_5112, L_5113, L_5114, L_5115, L_5116, L_5117, L_5118, L_5119, L_5120, L_5121, L_5122, L_5123, L_5124, L_5125, L_5126, L_5127, L_5128, L_513, L_5130, L_5131, L_5132, L_5133, L_5134, L_5135, L_5136, L_5137, L_5138, L_5139, L_514, L_5140, L_5141, L_5142, L_5143, L_5144, L_5145, L_5147, L_5148, L_5149, L_515, L_5150, L_5151, L_5129, L_5146",popova et al. 2015,Popova et al. 2015

The fossiliferous beds were deposited during the Atlantic transgression that covered northern Patagonia and other parts of South America from the Maastrichtian to the Danian. Teeth of several lamniform sharks are attributed to the anacoracid Squalicorax pristodontus and cf. Serratolamna serrata of indeterminate familial affinity. These taxa became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous and confirm the late Maastrichtian age previously assigned to the Jaguel Formation in this northwestern part of the Neuquen Basin. For the first time, the selachian faunas are described together with algae and dispersed organic matter assemblages (palynofacies), revealing new elements of the neritic biota leading up to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-L) mass extinction in South America. The palynoflora consists exclusively of the prasinophyte algae Tasmanites, Cymatiosphaera and Pterospermella, indicative of stratified saline waters. Dispersed organic components in the profile (mainly opaque equidimensional phytoclasts and prasinophytes) are consistent with an inner neritic environment, with evidence (a great variety of particle sizes, lath-shaped phytoclasts increasing slightly in number and decreasing number of marine components) of slightly more nearshore conditions towards the upper part of the profile. These marine biotas confirm the presence of an epeiric sea over northern Patagonia, which extended westwards to the volcanic arc on the western flank of the Andean Cordillera in Mendoza.Mercedes B.

The intertrappean elasmobranchs are represented mainly by rays and skates, whereas the Karai fauna is known by hexanchiform, squaliform, and lamniform sharks. The latter assemblage is dominated by cool temperate water forms in addition to some cosmopolitan forms. Here new shark teeth recovered from the upper part of the marine Cretaceous Bagh Group, in the lower Narmada valley, Western India are described. This is the first detailed description of sharks from the Bagh Group and the first record of sharks from the youngest horizons (Coniacian to Late Maastrichtian) of this marine sedimentary sequence. The fauna, recovered from an oyster shell-rich green sandstone at the top of the youngest geological unit (the Coralline Limestone) of the Bagh Group, is assigned to Ptychodus sp., Scapanorhynchus sp. aff. S. raphiodon (Agassiz, 1844), Cretodus sp. aff. C. crassidens (Dixon, 1850), Cretalamna sp., Squalicorax sp. aff. S. falcatus Agassiz, 1843, and Elasmobranchii indet. This assemblage, previously widely documented from the Cretaceous deposits of North and South Americas, Europe, North and West Africa, Far East and Near East, demonstrates that there is a clear change in elasmobranch faunal composition of India from cool temperate water forms in the early Late Cretaceous to essentially cosmopolitan forms in the Late Cretaceous.",Prasad,"Island Arc, 26 (5): e12200",Journal article,English,L,L_2206,"L_29342, L_29343, L_29344, L_29345, L_29346",prasad et al. 2017,Prasad et al. 2017

Palaeoecological analysis of the biota indicates an oligohaline intercalation within the marine part of the sections. This is additionally confirmed by the oxygen isotopic compositions of fish otoliths from the Mauensee section. The overlying marine sequence may represent a fourth cycle in the St. Gallen Formation that might perhaps indicate a Karpatian transgression from the Mediterranean Sea, which has not previously been recognized. Biostratigraphic comparison shows that the sedimentation of the Upper Freshwater Molasse began at the base of the Karpatian in southwest Germany and eastern Switzerland, and in the Middle Karpatian in central Switzerland.

The recovered elasmobranch remains are mainly isolated teeth, and less commonly gill rakers, caudal spines, thorns, dermal denticles and vertebrae. The fauna is the richest thus far reported from shelf regions of the southern North Sea Basin and also one of the most diverse elasmobranch faunas collected from the Early and Middle Miocene of Europe. The sediments of the LMFS Formation sampled at Werder-Uesen represent the upper levels of the early Hemmoor regional stage (‚ÄûBehrendorf substage‚Äú) which corresponds to the middle and late Burdigalian. The dinoflagellate cyst assemblage recovered at Werder-Uesen correlates with the Cousteaudinium aubryae Biozone of Dybkja er & Piasecki (2010) which has a late Burdigalian age. Most shark and ray genera of the Werder-Uesen fauna, e.g. Carcharias, Chaenogaleus, Carcharhinus, Galeocerdo, Hemipristis, Paragaleus, Rhizoprionodon, Sphyrna, Aetobatus, Dasyatis, Rhinobatos, Rhynchobatus, Rostroraja and Taeniura, are closely related with present-day neritic and benthic taxa dwelling in warm-temperate and subtropical shelf seas. In addition, a small but significant elasmobranch assemblage indicative of pelagic, oceanic habitats (9 species of Isurus, Alopias, Megachasma, Prionace, Megascyliorhinus, Plinthicus) is present, whereas taxa living in present-day deepwaters of the oceans and continental slopes (Hexanchus, Echinorhinus, Iago) are very rarely encountered. 25 shark and 8 batoid taxa of the Werder-Uesen fauna entered the Miocene North Sea Basin for the first time. The prominent increase in species richness, which is known also for other groups of vertebrates and invertebrates in the early Hemmoor regional stage, likely results from the middle to late Burdigalian warming that passed into the Mid-Miocene climate optimum. The common presence of some species of Isurus and Alopias in the LMFS Formation, compared with their uncommonness or absence in

Aquitanian to early Burdigalian sediments of the same region, supports the hypothesis, that a permanent marine connection became established in middle Burdigalian times between the southern North Sea and the warm-temperate eastern Atlantic. Interregional comparison shows a marked correspondence of shelf-related neritic and benthic taxa in boreal (North Sea), Mediterranean and central Paratethyan realms during the middle/late Burdigalian. This likely resulted from the shift and enlargement of warm-temperate/subtropical climate areas to northern latitudes which established similar thermophilic faunal assemblages by dispersion into the North Sea Basin via the eastern Atlantic. However, the lack of the present-day tropical/subtropical genera Ginglymostoma, Isogomphodon, Negaprion, Pseudocarcharias, Pteromylaeus, Rhinoptera and Pristis in the North Sea Basin and their partial presence in the Mediterranean Tethys and Central Paratethys indicates a faunal differentiation in the European Burdigalian which was probably governed by climatic factors.",Reinecke,"Palaeontos, 20: 1-170, 40 text-figures, 3 tables, 101 plates",Journal article,English,L,L_674,"L_8112, L_8084, L_8085, L_8086, L_8087, L_8088, L_8089, L_809, L_8090, L_8091, L_8092, L_8093, L_8094, L_8095, L_8096, L_8097, L_8098, L_8099, L_81, L_810, L_8100, L_8101, L_8102, L_8103, L_8104, L_8105, L_8106, L_8107, L_8108, L_8109, L_811, L_8110, L_8111, L_8113, L_8114, L_8115, L_8116, L_8117, L_8118, L_8119, L_812, L_8120, L_8121, L_8122, L_8123, L_8124, L_8125, L_8126, L_8127, L_8128, L_8129, L_813",reinecke et al. 2011,Reinecke et al. 2011

C. holmdelensis?, and two other fish (Hadrodus priscus and a pycnodont). This assemblage has important implications for Late Cretaceous chondrichthyan palaeobiogeography.

The teeth were collected mainly through surface-sampling and sieving. The Menuha Formation probably represents a temperate to subtropical, shallow, open-shelf environment deposited during the formation of the Ramon anticline. Reworked conglomeratic chalks in the western section represent marginal facies derived from this structural uplift. With little to no published material describing the chondrichthyan fauna of the Menuha Formation, these data improve interpretations of its palaeoenvironment.

The condrichthyes are a part of aquatic fauna since the Paleozoic. However, due to the nature of the cartilaginous skeleton, the paleontological registration of the same ones is restricted to mineralized parts like teeth, dermal denticles and cephalic spines.
The of formation, Farol das Lagostas has a fauna of selachian relatively rich and diverse, represented in this study for around 1.000 isolated teeth, and other skeletal parts. Forty four taxa were described and identified, belonging to the following orders: Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes, Pristiophoriformes, Squatiniformes, Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, Rajiformes e Myliobatiformes. It’s a faunal diversity whose most genera have current representatives.
The Carcharhiniformes represente 53% of the identified taxa. The represented families are Scyliorhinidae, Triakidae, Hemigaleidae, Carcharhinidae e Sphyrnidae, with 18 species.
There is presence of benthic and nektonic forms that indicate moderate thermal conditions, the temperate and tropical hot, often inhabit coastal areas.
The identified faunal relation corresponds to a coastal zone. So, considering the data set, due to the presence of pelagic fauna and large predators, especially Isurus hastalis e Carcharocles megalodon, we can admit that then there was a relatively large Gulf of open Atlantic range (Antunes & Balbino, 2004).",Rodríguez-Gria,Universidade Nova de Lisboa,Thesis,Portugese,L,L_838,"L_9030, L_9031, L_9032, L_9033, L_9034, L_9035, L_9036, L_9038, L_9039, L_904, L_9040, L_9041, L_9042, L_9043, L_9044, L_9045, L_9046, L_9047, L_9048, L_9049, L_905, L_9050, L_9051, L_9052, L_9053, L_9054, L_9055, L_9056, L_9057, L_9058, L_9059, L_906, L_9060, L_9061, L_9062, L_9063, L_9064, L_9065, L_9066, L_9067, L_9068, L_9069, L_9037",rodriguez gria 2016,Rodriguez-gria 2016

Associated with large shark vertebrae from Canary Station, near Boulia, Queensland, are numerous placoid scales of four primary types which indicate a large pelagic shark. The Canary specimen is one of the few Mesozoic sharks known where scales have been found associated with vertebrae. Problems in referring the new shark material to the Anacoracidae and Pseudocorax are discussed. The significance of vertebral structure and scale morphology in Mesozoic shark evolution and ecology is examined.

Six major tectonic units have been thrust and stacked upon each other, which include from the southeast to the northwest the Lower Penninic, the Ultrahelvetic, the Upper and the Lower Helvetic as well as the Subalpine and the Plateau Molasse. The Plateau Molasse is only weakly deformed and covers more than one third of the mapped domain. It comprises rocks of the Lower Freshwater Molasse (USM), the Upper Marine Molasse (OMM) and the Upper Freshwater Molasse (OSM). Its southern boundary is defined by a south-vergent backthrust that also defines the northern boundary of the Subalpine Molasse. The Subalpine Molasse comprises the Triangle zone, made up of intensively deformed USM rocks, the Hornbüel-Schuppenzone (a tectonic mélange) and thrusted imbricated southeastdipping slices including USM rocks (Schangnau slice) and, to some extent, rocks of the Lower Marine Molasse (UMM) in the case of the Beichlen-Farneren and Hilfern slices. The Helvetic units, situated farther south, comprise sedimentary rocks of the Subalpine Flysch zone (Lower Helvetic), the Drusberg nappe (Upper Helvetic) and the Habkern mélange (Ultrahelvetic). Sandstone and mudstone beds of the Subalpine Flysch zone are intensively folded and faulted. The overlying Drusberg nappe is made up of an Early Cretaceous succession of micritic and biomicritic limestones and marls at the base and – after an angular unconformity – an Eocene suite of quartzitic sandstones, biomicrites and marls at the top. These units strike southwest to northeast. Most of them are isoclinal and dip towards the southeast. At Schimberig, however, the units of the Drusberg nappe are thrust to form a duplex. Farther to the southeast, the Habkern mélange is situated between the Drusberg and the Schlieren nappes. This tectonic mélange is made up of intensively folded and faulted sandstones and marls («Wildflysch») with embedded megablocks of the Wang Formation. It was possibly formed by synsedimentary processes. The Schlieren nappe (Lower Penninic) represents the highest tectonic unit in the map area. It comprises a Late Cretaceous to Paleogene suite of sandstones and marls that were deposited by submarine mass flows. The two folds of the Schlieren beds strike in an oblique direction, if the dip of the Helvetic rocks is used as reference. Numerous till deposits and U-shaped valleys document the presence of at least two glaciations. Vast landslides are rooted either in glacial till or flysch de-posits and ",Schlunegger,"Bundesamt für Landestopografie, CH–3084 Wabern, pp. 108",Journal article,German,L,"L_835, L_836, L_837","L_9028, L_9029, L_903",schlunegger et al. 2016,Schlunegger et al. 2016

Marine vertebrates from this formation include plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, bony fish, sharks, and turtles. They are concentrated in the lower portion of the Tropic Shale, mostly between Bentonites B and D. Study of the taphonomic condition of these vertebrates has contributed to an understanding of how they were preserved as well as a detailed paleoenvironment for the Tropic Shale. Physical factors played the dominant role in their preservation, with robust and durable skeletal elements, such as teeth and vertebrae, being most common within the shale. Isolated bones and teeth are also relatively common within the formation, while complete and nearly complete skeletons are more rare. Biological factors played a less dominant role, with no evidence of epifaunal or infaunal activity preserved with any of the skeletal remains. In addition, scavenging marks (both bite and gnaw marks) are relatively uncommon, typically only being found on more complete specimens. A signature of post-burial alteration can be recognized as low levels of abrasion, weathering, and compression and high levels of fracturing of vertebrate skeletal material. Slightly higher levels of abrasion and weathering occur to the west, closer to the ancient shoreline, suggesting some pre-burial alteration. The preservation of marine vertebrates in the Tropic Shale suggests a low energy marine environment with some weak bottom currents and low levels of benthic oxygen. The substrate ranged from soft and soupy to firm, with moderate sedimentation rates resulting in relatively rapid burial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The validity of the genus Protolamna Cappetta, 1980 is confirmed, and diagnoses for both genera are amended. Teeth of Leptostyrax differ in many aspects from teeth of Protolamna including non-continuous cutting edges between main cusp and lateral cusplets, basally compressed main cusp, short root branches forming a “V”, and a less developed lingual protuberance compared to teeth of Protolamna. A very remarkable difference is the lingual crown ornamentation, which is very faint and restricted to the crown base in Leptostyrax, whereas it comprises long folds reaching up to the cusp tip in Protolamna.

This highly fossiliferous deposit (the ‘Ten Bits Microsite’) yielded about 5000 teeth, spines, and denticles in a small amount of matrix (c. 150 kg). About 30 identifiable species of sharks, rays, and bony fishes are recognized. Two of the three most abundant chondrichthyan species at Ten Bits (Scapanorhynchus texanus and Ischyrhiza mira) are also the most common species in other middle to late Campanian marine vertebrate faunas along the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain. The myliobatiform rays Brachyrhizodus and Rhombodus that occur at Ten Bits also appear to be characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, as are lamniform sharks such as Cretalamna and Serratolamna. These taxa are entirely absent or extremely rare in Western Interior Campanian faunas. In contrast, some small orectolobiform sharks (Cantioscyllium, Chiloscyllium, Columbusia) and small rays (Protoplatyrhina) found at Ten Bits are common in shallow water faunas of the Western Interior and Texas Coastal Plain, but rarely reported from the eastern Gulf or Atlantic Coast. The common Western Interior ray Myledaphus bipartitus does not occur at Ten Bits or in any Gulf or Atlantic Coast fauna. Ptychotrygon agujaensis is abundantly represented in the Ten Bits fauna, but unknown in correlative marine faunas. Although Ptychotrygon occurs in all Western Interior, Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain faunas, it is represented elsewhere by apparently endemic species at each collection site. The differences between Western Interior, Gulf, and Atlantic Coastal Plain faunas probably reflect latitudinal variation in water temperature or salinity, or different oceanic water circulation patterns between the Western Interior Seaway and the Gulf or Atlantic Coast that restricted the distributions of some marine fish species. The Ten Bits fauna shares typical species with both Western Interior and Gulf and Atlantic Coast faunas, reflecting its position at the border between these provinces; however, the dominant taxa found at Ten Bits are the same as those found on the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and indicate that western Texas was more closely allied biogeographically with that province than with the Western Interior of North America. One species tentatively identified in the Ten Bits fauna on the basis of a single tooth, Igdabatis cf. I. indicus, is otherwise known only from southern Europe and Asia, although a similar large myliobatid ray also occurs rarely in Texas Coastal Plain faunas. These occurrences indicate that western Texas may have been near the northern limit of the range for some tropical Tethyan marine vertebrate species.",Schubert,"Cretaceous Research, 69: 6–33",Journal article,English,L,L_2054,"L_28759, L_2876, L_28760, L_28761, L_28762, L_28763, L_28764, L_28765, L_28766, L_28767, L_28768, L_28769, L_2877, L_28770, L_28771, L_28772, L_28773, L_28774, L_28775, L_28776, L_28777, L_28778, L_28779",schubert et al. 2017,Schubert et al. 2017

The combined fish fauna from the two Leisey sites is composed of 73 species, including 23 species of sharks and rays and 50 species of bony fish. This is the largest fish fauna ever reported from the Cenozoic of Florida, and includes 34 taxa that represent new additions to the fossil record of the state. There are four extinct taxa in the fauna, all of which are Chondrichthyes: the mako shark Isurus hastalis, the nurse shark Ginglymostoma serra, the snaggletooth shark Hemipristis serra, and the guitarfish Rhynchobatus sp. The genera Hemipristis and Rhynchobatus are now restricted to the Indo-West Pacific region. The two sites comprising the Leisey Shell Pit Local Fauna, Leisey 1A and Leisey 3A, have somewhat different faunas. The most common fish from Leisey 1A in decreasing order of abundance are: alligator gar Atractosteus spatula; snook Centropomus sp.; mullet Mugil sp.; bull shark Carcharhinus leucas; and eagle ray Myliobatis sp. These species, as well as the majority of the remaining fauna, suggest a shallow marine or estuarine environment such as a coastal bay or mouth of a large river. In contrast, the Leisey 3A ichthyofauna is dominated by the freshwater sunfish family Centrarchidae, in particular, redear sunfish Lepomis microlophus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, and redbreast sunfish L. auritus. Other common fish from Leisey 3 A are found in freshwater habitats as well, including: Mugil sp.; freshwater catfish of the family Ictaluridae; bowfin Amia calva; lake chubsucker Erimyzon sucetta; killifish Fundulus seminolis, golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas; and pickerel Esox sp.

The Juana Lopez Member overlies the Blue Hill Member of the Carlile Shale and is overlain by the D-Cross Member of the Mancos Shale. The Turonian ammonite assemblage of the Juana Lopez Member includes Prionocyclus cf. P. hyatti (Stanton), Prionocyclus macombi Meek, Coilopoceras colleti Hyatt, Prionocyclus wyomingensis Meek, Scaphites warreni Meek and Hayden, Scaphites whitfieldi Cobban and Prionocyclus novimexicanus (Marcou). Most of the ammonite diversity in the Juana Lopez Member at Galisteo Dam is in the upper calcarenite interval and is dominated by P. novimexicanus, S. whitfieldi and S. warreni with an occasional P. wyomingensis. The middle shale interval has a low diversity ammonite assemblage dominated by P. macombi with an occasional C. colleti, both occurring as three-dimensional specimens in concretions. P. macombi has also been reported to occur in the lower calcarenite at the type section. Three specimens of P. cf. P. hyatti were collected from a concretion together with P. macombi low in the middle shale interval. The selachian assemblage of the Juana Lopez Member is dominated by Ptychodus whipplei Marcou, with rare specimens of Squalicorax falcatus (Agassiz) and Cretodus semiplicatus (Munster).

The Batoid assemblages of Baripada Beds are represented by nine genera comprising of Myliobatis, Aetobatus, Rhinoptera, Dasyatis, Raja, Rhinobatus, Rhyncobatus, Pristis and Gymnura. Our record of Rhyncobatus sp. is significant as it is the first such report from Indian subcontinent. Presence of Gymnura sp. is also being described for the first time from the eastern coast of India. We also describe additional specimens and skeletal remains that were not discovered earlier. Our findings, combined with earlier finds of crocodilian coprolite, fish fauna, gastropods, bivalves, pelecypods, and foraminifers, suggests that the Baripada Beds were deposited in a shore environment, probably in the shallower part of the inner neretic, tropical to subtropical environment, well connected to the open seas.",Sharma,"Earth Science India, 6 (4): 160-184",Journal article,English,L,"L_315, L_316","L_5969, L_597, L_5970, L_5971, L_5972, L_5973, L_5974, L_5975, L_5976, L_5977, L_5978, L_5979, L_6061, L_6062, L_6063, L_6064, L_6065, L_6066, L_6067, L_6068, L_6069",sharma & patnaik 2013,Sharma & Patnaik 2013

The fossil fish assemblage recorded in this contribution from these beds comprise of sharks (48%), batoids (31%) and teleosts (20%). The paper reports the selachian species namely, Carcharhinus aff. C. sorrah, Carcharhinus aff. C. priscus and Negaprion eurybathrodon and genera Galeorhinus and Rhizoprionodon for the first time from these beds. Teleost fish remains belonging to the family Characidae are also being reported here for the first time from these beds. Extant counterparts of most of the fossil fish taxa described here are well adapted to a normal temperature of approximately 200C isotherm. Palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental analyses based on the fossil fish assemblages in association with other vertebrate and invertebrate remains including those of foraminifers suggest presence of a shallow marine, nearshore coastal environment most likely representing the shallower part of the inner neretic linked to the open sea. The presence of a diverse fossil fish fauna corroborates well with an overall increase in the global biodiversity during the Miocene, due to a change in the climate caused by widespead tectonism leading to the rise of the Alpine-Himalaya and closure of the Tethys Sea.

We examined partial and nearly complete skeletons of three species ofSqualicorax, S. falcatus (Aoassiz),S. kaupi (Agassiz), andS. pristodontus (Agassiz), that were collected from the U.S.A. These specimens suggest that the total body length (TL) ofS. falcatus typically measured 1.8-2.0 m, and probably did not exceed 3 m. Moderatesized individuals ofS. kaupi andS. pristodontus perhaps measured about 3 m TL. AlthoughS. pristodontus was the largest form among the three species examined, this taxon possessed a set of large jaws (with large but fewer teeth) relative to its body size compared toS. falcatus orS. kaupi. This suggests that tooth size is not an accurate indicator of the TL if one compares oneSqualicorax species to another. Neurocranial features suggest that the vision ofSqualicorax was not as acute as that of a contemporaneous macrophagous lamniform shark,Cretoxyrhina mantelli (Agassiz) , but olfaction ofSqualicorax may have been better thanC. mantelli. The morphology of placoid scales suggests thatSqualicorax was capable of fast swimming. New skeletal data support the view that the feeding dynamics ofSqualicorax was similar to the modern tiger shark (Galeocerdo Müller & Henle). The present data do not allow for exact ordinal placement, but, contrary to some previous interpretations,Squalicorax can be excluded from the Hexanchiformes and Orectolobiformes.

The specimen preserves the posterior half of the vertebral column and a series of hypochordal rays.

The specimen also supports the idea that the body form of C. mantelli resembled that of the extant white shark, Carcharodon carcharias (Linneaus). Given a total vertebral count in Cretoxyrhina mantelli of about 230, this specimen suggests that the transition between precaudal and caudal vertebrae was somewhere between the 140 th and 160 th vertebrae. The estimated total body length of the specimen described here ranges from 640 cm to 700 cm, marking the largest C. mantelli individual estimated to date.

The lowest portion of the Greenhorn Limestone, the base of the Lincoln Limestone Member, contains calcarenite beds rich in disarticulated remains of marine vertebrates. We examined the composition of the vertebrate paleofauna from one particular location (Tobe locality) through surface collecting and acid solution of rocks. The paleofauna is taxonomically diverse, consisting of 22 chondrichthyans, at least 15 osteichthyan fishes, and six aquatic reptiles. Molluscan taxa indicate that the basal Lincoln Limestone in southeastern Colorado was deposited sometime between middle Middle Cenomanian (ca. 95 Ma) and late Middle Cenomanian (ca. 94.7 Ma), and the composition of the vertebrate fauna (primarily chondrichthyan taxa) agrees with this interpretation. The Tobe locality was situated far from the shorelines of the Western Interior Seaway, with relatively high-energy waves impinging upon the seafloor, concentrating biogenic remains. Fossil remains within the calcarenite appear to have undergone minor time-averaging, based upon erosional rounding and breakage present in numerous specimens. Nevertheless, the deposit contains one of the best representative Middle Cenomanian vertebrate communities so far described from the Western Interior Seaway of North America.

yielded rich and diverse
selachian faunas. Strata of latest
Early Campanian, earliest Maastrichtian, mid-Maastrichtian, and
Middle-Late Danian age have been sampled. The Early Campanian
glauconitic and calcareous quartz sands and biocalcarenites of
the Kristianstad Basin,

subtropical shallow water
environment,
contain a selachian
assemblage
dominated by
small
orectolobids,
squatinids,
heterodontids,
triakids,
and scyliorhinids. A very diverse
lamniform assemblage with
13 identified species
forms
a
conspicuous part of the fauna. Squaloids, scyliorhinids and
orectolobids are the three major selachian groups in the
earliest Maastrichtian calcisiltites and calcarenites of the
Kristianstad Basin and the mid-Maastrichtian pelagic
chalk
quarried at Kvarnby. Carcharhiniformes, mainly Palaeogaleus and
various scyliorhinids, dominates the Middle-Late Dania faunas
of the Limhamn quarry.

The material allows for a much-needed revision of the Late Albian anacoracids from North America. The previously recognized Squalicorax sp., also referred to as S. volgensis in more recent publications, is a mix of two different species: S. priscoserratus sp. nov. and S. pawpawensis sp. nov. In addition to these two new species, a single tooth is assigned to S. aff. S. baharijensis. Our data indicate that anacoracids were a considerably more diverse group in the North American Cretaceous than previously thought. We attribute much of the underestimation of diversity to vague species concepts, poor preparation techniques and the associated lack of attention to certain dental features, in particular neck morphology, root surface porosity and the root's vascularization.",Siverson,"Palaeontology, 50 (4): 939–950",Journal article,English,L,L_2965,"L_5098, L_5099, L_51",siverson et al. 2007,Siverson et al. 2007

This reworked fauna suggests that the Bois-Gilles Sand Formation, lateral equivalent of the Ressons Sands, was deposited at the Dormaal site, but subsequently completely eroded during the incision of the Dormaal palaeovalley. The Dormaal assemblage is dominated by rather large sharks, indicating warm, shallow marine habitats with normal salinity and sandy sea-bottoms. The evolutionary history of the European shallow water elasmobranchii is marked by a series of events, of which three are major. The Dormaal association represents the third diversification event, dated as late Thanetian.

recolectados dentro de una excavación paleontológica en el yacimiento Los
Dedos, Caldera y el reconocimiento de la tafonomía de los fósiles en estudio, para así contextualizarlos en la estratigrafía levantada en terreno. Como metodología de muestreo se realizó una excavación paleontológica de 20 metros cuadrados de manera escalonada, dividiendo la excavación en 9 niveles, recolectando más de 8.500 kg de material de los cuales 4.500 kg fueron procesados para la realización de esta investigación. La metodologíautilizada para el estudio taxonómico de los dientes se realizó sobre la comparación de la morfología dental y su posición morfotípica dentro de la mandíbula, con empleo de bibliografía sobre Lamniformes fósiles y mandíbulas de Lamniformes actuales. Se recolectaron 449 dientes de tiburones Lamniformes, identificando en total 15 taxones distribuidos en 6 familias y 11 géneros, y un taxón de familia incierta. Los fósiles corresponden a los géneros Carcharodon, Cosmopolitodus, Isurus, Isurolamna?, Carcharias, Odontaspis, Megachasma, Cetorhinus, Parotodus, Alopias y Otodus (Megaselachus). Las especies más abundantes en el registro estratigráfico son Cosmopolitodus, Carcharodon carcharias e Isurus aff. oxyrhinchus. Los principales procesos que inciden en el estado tafonómico de los fósiles serían el cambio de color del esmaltoide de la corona por carbonificación, utilizado como un criterio de reelaboración en conjunto con la distorsión de la raíz por fracturas tipo planares, como consecuencia a la previa permineralización de los tejidos de ella. Como criterio de resedimentación la abrasión de la raíz parece ser un buen indicador, a pesar de no conseguir suficiente muestra para un estudio estadístico que indicara diferentes grados de abrasión. Otros procesos como bioerosión de la corona por líquenes y concreción de dientes en nódulos fosforíticos fueron detectados dentro de los mecanismos tafonómicos. Con el registro tafonómico obtenido se determinó la sucesión registrática de la excavación en base a las relaciones topológicas entre las entidades fósiles, obteniendo 15 asociaciones registráticas en total. De los fósiles identificados, se cita por primera vez dentro de la Fm. Coquimbo a las especies Isurolamna? sp., Alopias vulpinus y “Megachasma” aff. applegatei y se figuran dientes identificados como Cetorhinus sp. B, Carcharias sp. A y Carcharias sp. B con morfotipos nunca antes vistos para estos géneros. Además, se comparan las faunas del Neógeno con las actuales, identificando un episodio de extinción que afectó de manera total a 4 de los 11 géneros descritos, y a 2 géneros solo de forma local, restringiendo su rango de ubicación paleobiogeográfica hasta zonas de climas cálidos y tropicales.

The locality (now NMMNH L-5153) yields numerous teeth and bone fragments from a localized, 0.7-m-thick intrabasinal ferruginous conglomerate composed of limestone, tooth, bone, bivalve shell and chert pebbles in a section of fine-grained sandstone near the top of the Atarque Sandstone. Virtually all of the teeth and bones from this bed were broken prior to fossilization, and based on the lithology of the bonebed and fossil preservation, we interpret this fossil site as an allochthonous assemblage in a storm deposit. The following selachian taxa were previously known to be present in this assemblage: Hybodus sp., Ptychodus whipplei, P. cf. P. mammillaris, Chiloscyllium greeni, Scapanorhynchus raphiodon, Cretodus semiplicatus, cf. Paranomodon sp., Squalicorax falcatus, Rhinobatos sp., Pseudohypolophus mcnultyi, Ischyrhiza schneideri and Ptychotrygon triangularis. Our collection duplicates many of the selachian taxa previously known from this assemblage, and also includes numerous teleost teeth, especially of pycnodonts assigned to aff. Coelodus and Micropycnodon cf. M. kansasensis. Freshwater turtle shell fragments and a dromaeosaur tooth are also present, indicating a freshwater/terrestrial component to the assemblage. Scapanorhynchus dominates the assemblage, and the sedimentology, terrestrial taxa, assemblage diversity and rarity of Ptychodus suggest a nearshore association.

"Squires, R.L.",2012,,"Late pliocene megafossils of the Pico Formation, Newhall Area Los Angeles County, Southern California.",Contributions in Science,,"Taxonomic composition and stratigraphic distribution of megafossils in the Pico Formation south of Newhall, northern Los Angeles County, Southern California, are described in detail. Eighty-three taxa, from 15 localities, were found: one brachiopod, 36 bivalves, 40 gastropods, one scaphopod, one crab, one barnacle, one sea urchin, one shark, and one land plant. All are illustrated here. The pectinid bivalve Argopecten invalidus (Hanna, 1924) is put into synonymy with A. subdolus (Hertlein, 1925) and A. callidus (Hertlein, 1925). Rare specimens of the gastropods Calliostoma and Ocinebrina might be new species.The mollusks, which are indicative of a late Pliocene age, lived in waters of inner sublittoral depths and normal marine salinity. Most of the 41 extant species indicate warm-temperate waters similar to those occurring today off the adjacent coast, although a few species, both extant and extinct, indicate a southerly warmer water component. The fauna lived predominantly in, or on, soft sands, but a few lived on other shells or possibly on large rock clasts.Geologic field mapping done as part of this present study revealed that the Pico Formation south of Newhall was deposited at the site where a braided river entered the marine environment (i.e., braid delta). Initially, the river gravel and coarse sand interfingered with relatively deep offshore silts, barren of megafauna, in the lower and middle parts of the formation. Eventually, the delta built up, and the resulting shoaling conditions in the upper part of the formation were conducive for the megafauna to live in, or immediately adjacent to, the deltaic shoreface fine sands. Storm waves raked the delta and concentrated the shells of the megafauna, along with cobbles of igneous and metamorphic basement rocks, into channelized deposits. Postmortem transport distance was short, as evidenced by many paired-valved bivalve shells.",Squires,"Contributions in Science, 520: 73-93",Journal article,English,L,L_323,L_6256,squires 2012,Squires 2012

Ischyrhiza mira had about 16 or 17 functional spines and about the same number of replacement spines on each side of the rostrum in which tall erect spines occupied the anterior one-half to two-third of the rostrum followed posteriorly by smaller spines. Whereas small hat-shaped dermal denticles were distributed on the rostrum, large thorn-like dermal denticles were present on the dorsal side of the body characteristic of sluggish, benthic batoids. We concur with the interpretation that specimens previously identified as rostral spines of Peyeria are actually enlarged thorn-like dermal denticles of a sclerorhynchid. We suggest that the ratio between the rostrum length and total body length of sclerorhynchids was generally about 1:3.27. Our vertebra-based ontogenetic analysis of I. mira gives an age estimate of 12.4 years for a 190-cm-long individual, the size at birth of about 0.5 m, and the maximum possible length for the species of no more than 3 m.

At the moment 65 species are known from this unit, of which 31 are represented in our samples by otoliths or teeth. The fish fauna of the Clay of Boom is essentially a marine fauna suggesting that the clay was deposited in a calm, rather deep part of the continental shelf.

The Elasmobranch fauna has no biostratigraphic value, although 5 new species were identified: Pristiophorus rupeliensis, Raja casieri, Raja cecilae, Raja heinzelini and Raja terhagenesis.

The Teleostean fauna is dominated by Gadidae.a typical Northern Atlantic group, and includes one species new to science «genus Gadidarum ensiformis. The dominance of Gadids reflects the progressive replacement of the Indo-Pacific fauna existing during the Eocene, by a more Atlantic one. Some of the 69 lithological subunits recognized on lithological features, are also characterized by different otolith associations and can be correlated in the different quarries sampled. Some of these (49, 41 and 35) are further more characterized by a high frequency of otoliths; therefore these can probably be localised in borings and used for correlation. The Teleostean - otoliths permit a local biozonation of the Clay of Boom. The upper part of the clay is limited below by bed 38 and characterized by the association Argentina parvula - «genus Gadidarum parvus (typical form), the middle part by «genus Gadidarum parvus (thick-set-form) and the lower part of which bed 30 forms the top is characterized by the association Raniceps tuberculosus - Trisopterus elegans.

Only incidental references to the selachians have been previously published. Through the efforts of Ms. Gerralynn Thomas, a sample of selachians and associated marine vertebrates from the Late Cretaceous Dakota Rose Granite Quarry was made available to us for study. Newly recognized selachian taxa from the quarry include: Ptychodus whipplei Marcou, 1858, Cretoxyrhina mantelli (Agassiz, 1843), Cretolamna appendiculata (Agassiz, 1843), Cretodus crassidens (Dixon, 1850), Leptostyrax compressidens (Herman, 1975), Scapanorhynchus rhaphiodon (Agassiz, 1844), Ptychotrygon triangularis (Reuss, 1844), and Pseudohypolophus mcnultyi (Thurmond, 1971). Squalicorax falcatus (Agassiz, 1843) was previously mentioned; the fsurus of two previous papers has been reidentified as Cretoxyrhina mantelli. Additional investigation of the teleosts indicates that previous reference to a specimen of Cimolichthys nepaholica (Cope, 1872) should be amended to Pachyrhizodus minimus Stewart, 1899. A few tooth fragments of a pliosaurid plesiosaur, provisionally referred to Brachauchenius Williston, 1903, were discovered. The evolutionary stage of the selachian assemblage approximates that of the Codell Sandstone in Kansas and of the basal part of the Austin Chalk in Texas.

The bonebed formed at a paleolatitude near 24 degrees S, with an Atlantic width at that latitude approximating 2700 km, roughly half that of the current width. The locality lies on an uncharacteristically narrow continental shelf near transform faults that controlled the coastal outline of Africa in the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean. Biostratigraphic change through the Bentiaba section indicates that the accumulation occurred in an ecological time dimension within the 240 ky bin delimited by chron 32n.1n. The fauna occurs in a 10 m sand unit in the Mocuio Formation with bones and partial skeletons concentrated in, but not limited to, the basal 1-2 m. The sediment entombing the fossils is an immature feldspathic sand shown by detrital zircon ages to be derived from nearby granitic shield rocks. Specimens do not appear to have a strong preferred orientation and they are not concentrated in a strand line. Stable oxygen isotope analysis of associated bivalve shells indicates a water temperature of 18.5 degrees C. The bonebed is clearly mixed with scattered dinosaur and pterosaur elements in amarine assemblage. Gut contents, scavenging marks and associated shed shark teeth in the Bench 19 Fauna indicate biological association and attrition due to feeding activities. The ecological diversity of mosasaur species is shown by tooth and body- size disparity and by delta C-13 analysis of tooth enamel, which indicate a variety of foraging areas and dietary niches. The Bench 19 Fauna was formed in arid latitudes along a coastal desert similar to that of modern Namibia on a narrow, tectonically controlled continental shelf, in shallow waters below wave base. The area was used as a foraging ground for diverse species, including molluscivorus Globidens phosphaticus, small species expected near the coast, abundant Prognathodon kianda, which fed on other mosasaurs at Bench 19, and species that may have been transient and opportunistic feeders in the area.",Strganac,"Netherlands Journal of Geosciences, Geologie En Mijnbouw, 94 (1): 121–136",Journal article,English,L,L_2057,"L_28786, L_28787, L_28788, L_2879",strganac et al. 2015,Strganac et al. 2015

Abstract.",II Simposio – Paleontología en Chile,,"Isurolamna Cappetta corresponde a un género controversial de tiburones fósiles que desde su creación agrupó a especies previamente reconocidas como odontaspídidos y lámnidos. Su diagnosis indica dientes anteriores superiores similares a los del género Isurus (Lamnidae), con una corona inclinada y una cara labial plana, sin dentículos laterales o excepcionalmente uno medial, mientras que los dientes laterales presentan coronas inclinadas en sentido posterior y poseen dentículos laterales de forma triangular, bien separados de la corona. La raíz es de aspecto rectangular y relativamente masiva, con un único foramen nutricio. Las especies válidas del género son Isurolamna bajarunasi (Glikman y Zhelezko; Eoceno medio-superior de Kazakhstán); I. gracilis (Le Hon; Oligoceno inferior de Europa); I. inflata (Leriche; Paleoceno superior-Eoceno inferior del norte de África, Europa y Norteamérica); e I. vandenbroecki (Winkler; Oligoceno inferior de Europa y Kazakhstan). En afloramientos paleógenos ubicados al sur de la caleta Loanco, en el sector Punta La Vieja, Región del Maule, se encontraron 10 dientes de tiburones asociados a dos vértebras y fragmentos de cartílago mandibular excepcionalmente preservado (SGO.PV.6635, Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, Santiago). Estos nuevos materiales brindan por primera vez elementos diagnósticos que permiten precisar la asignación a nivel de Familia del género Isurolamna. La presencia de dientes con coronas rectas y otros con coronas inclinadas permite reconocer sus respectivas posiciones en la mandíbula, y de este modo verificar que tanto los dientes anteriores como los laterales poseen dentículos laterales, descartándose la presencia de dientes anteriores similares a los del género Isurus. La nueva evidencia fósil aquí presentada indica que el género Isurolamna fue fundado a partir de material tipo que comprende una asociación de dientes pertenecientes tanto a odontaspídidos como a lámnidos, lo que ha generado discusiones respecto a la Familia a la que pertenece este taxón. Por lo tanto, las especies de este género formarían un clado polifilético. Este hallazgo sugiere una edad eoceno-oligocena temprana para los estratos portadores, distinguiéndose de los afloramientos del Cretácico Superior localizados directamente al norte del área estudiada, y al sur, en el sector de Chanco y del estero Mariscadero. El nuevo registro se suma al de peces óseos xiphiorinquinos encontrados en el área, grupo reconocido en otras localidades del planeta sólo a partir del Paleógeno.

Judging from the habitat of Squalus and the occurrences of shallow-sea fish fossils, such as Eosardinella hishinaiensis and Family Clupeidae, it is estimated that the sea which deposited the lower part of the Iseyama Formation was the continental or insular shelf and from shelf edge to shelf slope which was fell sharply from the shallow sea of coastal or bay zone with surface warm current.",Suzuki,"Earth Science (Chikyu Kagaku), 61 (1): 67-72",Journal article,Japanese,L,L_343,L_6801,suzuki 2007a,Suzuki 2007a

[in japanese]",Earth Science (Chikyu Kagaku),,"Many specimens of deep-sea shark fossils, four genera - Etmopterus, Deania, Somniosus and Centroscymnus - which were recovered from the Yokoo and Iseyama Formations, are systematically described in this study. Therefore, it is concluded that Six genera - Squalus, Etmopterus, Centrophorus, Deania, Somniosus and Dalatias - occurred in the upper part of the Yokoo Formation, and seven genera - Squalus, Etmopterus, Centrophorus, Deania, Centroscymnus, Centroselachus and Dalatias - occurred in the lower part of the Iseyama Formation. It is extremely rare for deep-sea shark fossils such as these to accumulate in almost the same location. In particular, specimens of three genera, Etmopterus, Centroscymnus and Centroselachus, which were found in the lower part of the Iseyama Formation, have retained the shape of part of a symphysial tooth row, and Dalatias licha occurred as remains such as tooth and dermal denticle sets. These findings indicate that the symphysial teeth and tooth sets had not been long detached from living or dead sharks when they were deposited immediately together with muddy sediment. As a result, those that fossilized on one sea bottom retained a shape almost identical to living shark dentition. These fossils and their modes of occurrence are important for research on the paleoenvironment during the Middle Miocene time in Ueda City and the Northern Fossa Magna Region. This investigation led to the following conclusions. 1) Deep-sea shark fossils from the Yokoo and Iseyama Formations were classified into eight genera, Squalus, Centrophorus, Deania, Etmopterus, Centroscymnus, Centroselachus, Somniosus and Dalatias, belonging to five families within the order Squaliformes. Accordingly, the presence of a deep-sea shark assemblage was established in the Middle Miocene Yokoo and Iseyama Formations in Ueda City, Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. 2) The paleoenvironment in this area changes continuously from a continental slope into a continental slope and abyssal plain.",Suzuki,"Earth Science (Chikyu Kagaku), 66 (2): 47-61",Journal article,Japanese,L,"L_345, L_346, L_347","L_6804, L_6805, L_6806, L_6807, L_6808, L_6809, L_681, L_6810, L_6811, L_6812, L_6813, L_6814, L_6815, L_6816, L_6817",suzuki 2012,Suzuki 2012

This paper reports the newly discovered and diverse fossil assemblage of deep-sea sharks from the Miocene deposits in the southwestern part of Gunma Prefecture, central Japan. The specimens are isolated teeth found from seven localities of three Middle Miocene formations. These fossils are identified into twelve species of eleven genera belonging to eight families within three orders: eight species from the Obata Formation (earliest Middle Miocene) of the Tomioka Group, six species from the Haratajino Formation (early Middle Miocene) of the Tomioka Group and four species from the Niwaya Formation (middle Middle Miocene) of the Annaka Group. Four genera, Centrophorus, Deania, Squaliolus and Mitsukurina represent the first fossil record in the Northwest Pacific. Somniosus and Centroscymnus mark the second record from the Miocene in the world, and Etmopterus and Pseudocarcharias indicate the second in the circum-Pacific. On the basis of lithofacies, benthic foraminifers and other megafossils, three formations are thought to have been deposited under outer sublittoral to middle bathyal environments. Since these environments accord with the Recent species habitats of the eleven shark genera, this fossil deep- sea shark fauna similar to the recent one in species/generic composition had been habited in bathyal environment. The presence of this Miocene fauna suggests that the outline of the recent deep-sea shark fauna in the Northwest Pacific region .would have been already established the Miocene.

The phenomenon of habitat segregation is common in living sharks. The difference of specific component in two formations is also able to interpret as the difference of habit and habitat in fossil sharks. And the chronological range of the upper part of Bessho Formation and the lower part of Aoki Formation is short. These suggest that two assemblages of two formations were able to integrate essentially one assemblage. The Bessho Formation yields not only deep-sea squaloid sharks, but also coastal shark, Carcharhinus. It implies that sedimentation of the formation occurred in deep-sea environment that was close to land. And the defect of deep-sea sharks in the Aoki Formation might imply that shallowing and reduction of the sea. This fossil shark assemblage is abundant in Carcharhinus and Isurus, whereas it lacks Carcharias, Galeocerdo and batiods. This component of the genera indicates that the assemblage of the Bessho and Aoki Formations would be recognized as Carcharhinus - Isurus assemblage, which is one of typical elasmobranch assemblages in Miocene of southwestern Japan.

Bioapatite may be diagenetically altered, however, with ions added or removed post-mortem; such change is typically assessed using destructive and demanding techniques. Here, Raman spectroscopy is used as a rapid and non-destructive way to identify significant diagenetic alteration of fossil bioapatite. We found spectral parameters of phosphate symmetric stretching (ν1-PO43−) to be very sensitive to variations in apatite chemistry, particularly with respect to common diagenetic components (CO32−, F−, Sr2+). The Raman spectral parameters were subsequently applied to a set of modern (biogenic) and geologic (magmatic) apatite samples as potential endmembers for diagenetic alteration. Raman spectra were also collected from enamel and dentin (respectively resistant vs. alteration-prone) of fossil teeth. Phosphate-oxygen isotopic values from the same enamel-dentin samples were used as an index of alteration and provided definition of Raman spectral parameters as relates to diagenetic alteration. Diagenetically altered samples were characterised by spectra with ν1-PO43− widths (at half maximum height) less than 13.0 cm− 1, and ν1-PO43− band positions greater than 964.7 cm− 1.

This report represents the highest concentration of basking shark gill rakers in the fossil record of Japan.

Based on sedimentary facies analysis combined with habitat data of extant sharks, habitats of Oligocene elasmobranchs were reconstructed. The result indicates that Oligocene sharks probably lived in an environment similar to that of extant sharks at the genus level. This does not support the previous hypotheses that some shark taxa (e.g., Hexanchus) existed within shallow environments during the Oligocene, and have since migrated into deeper water habitats.

"Toscano-Grande, A.",2016,,Vertebrados marinos del neógeno del suroeste de la Península Ibérica.,University of Huelv,,"This PHD thesis studies the marine vertebrates present in the Miocene and Pliocene formations of Southwestern Guadalquivir Basin in the province of Huelva, its evolutionary aspects and paleoecological implications. The results obtained allow to define with higher resolution the development of coastal and marine ecosystems in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula during the late Neogene. During this time, the two main pathways between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea were Norb√©tico Strait and the Strait Rif. The studied area for their paleogeographic situation between Atlantic and Mediterranean is in a prime location for the study of the fossil record of these groups.
 The Neogene studied materials belong to the following formations: Fm. Niebla (Tortoniense sup.) Fm. Arcillas de Gibrale√≥n (Tortoniense sup.-Messinian), and Fm. Arenas de Huelva (Pliocene inf.). Representative sites were selected and was made systematic sampling (350 kg.), and surface searches. Also, a facies mapping and geological sections ware made. The samples were sieved in the laboratory in order to separate the remains of small vertebrates, and microfossils to detail the paleoecological conditions and their dating. They also cleaned and consolidated large vertebrate fossils. The remains were cataloged, labeled and photographed.
 In all, it has obtained more than 3,000 teeth, 230 otoliths and 2000 skeletal remains, along with 8 skeletons of cetaceans. We have identified 116 taxa of marine vertebrate of the Neogene of Huelva. Of these, there are 50 species of sel√°ceos (sharks and rays), 5 holocephalans (chimeras), 48 Osteichthyes (bony fish), 1 Bird, 2 sea turtles and 10 marine mammals (2 seals, 4 cetacean baleen and 4 toothed whales). In total 43 taxa are species mentioned for the first time in the area, 16 of which are also for the first time in Spain. All this is a great contribution to paleocommunities vertebrate and its implications in the knowledge of the food chains of the past. The data have allowed to establish a paleoecological, biochronological paleobiogeographic and environmental approach. Thus, Niebla Fm. is characteristic of a shallow coastal environment of warm subtropical waters; Arcillas de Gibrale√≥n Fm. indicates a deep and far from shore environment, with open sea fauna of the area above the continental slope, between 150 and 400 m deep. Arenas de Huelva Fm. would be a shallower area of something deeper at the base and lesser on its roof continental shelf, from about 100 to about 30 m deep. It considerably increases the wildlife both in number and diversity. The shallowing by the silting of the Guadalquivir basin is well recorded in vertebrates associations. Fossils indicate a mixture of species of temperate and warm waters, with a predominance of the latter. This would indicate a subtropical climate somewhat warmer than it currently has in the area. In addition, communities of vertebrates other upper Neogene of Portugal, Greece Messinian, Pliocene of Catalonia, C. Valenciana, Murcia and Baleares, Italian Pliocene and Pliocene in Southeastern France were compared.
 All this is an improvement in the understanding of the marine ecosystem and paleoenvironmental evolution Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula during the late Tertiary or Cenozoic era.",Toscano-Grande,"Thesis, University of Huelva, Spain",Thesis,Spanish,L,"L_849, L_850, L_851, L_852, L_853, L_854, L_855, L_856, L_857, L_858, L_859, L_860, L_861, L_862, L_863, L_864, L_865, L_866","L_9109, L_9190, L_9246, L_9319, L_14273, L_17148, L_9104, L_9105, L_9106, L_9107, L_9108, L_911, L_9110, L_9111, L_9112, L_9113, L_9114, L_9115, L_9116, L_9117, L_9118, L_9119, L_912, L_9120, L_9121, L_9122, L_9123, L_9124, L_9125, L_9126, L_9127, L_9128, L_9129, L_913, L_9156, L_9157, L_9158, L_9159, L_916, L_9160, L_9161, L_9162, L_9163, L_9164, L_9165, L_9166, L_9167, L_9168, L_9169, L_917, L_9170, L_9171, L_9172, L_9173, L_9174, L_9175, L_9176, L_9177, L_9178, L_9179, L_918, L_9180, L_9181, L_9182, L_9183, L_9184, L_9185, L_9186, L_9187, L_9188, L_9189, L_919, L_9191, L_9192, L_9193, L_9194, L_9195, L_9196, L_9197, L_9198, L_9199, L_92, L_920, L_9200, L_9201, L_9202, L_9203, L_9204, L_9205, L_9206, L_9207, L_9208, L_9209, L_921, L_9210, L_9211, L_9212, L_9213, L_9214, L_9215, L_9216, L_9217, L_9218, L_9219, L_922, L_9220, L_9221, L_9222, L_9223, L_9224, L_9225, L_9226, L_9227, L_9228, L_9229, L_923, L_9230, L_9231, L_9232, L_9233, L_9234, L_9235, L_9236, L_9237, L_9238, L_9239, L_924, L_9240, L_9241, L_9242, L_9243, L_9244, L_9245, L_9247, L_9248, L_9249, L_925, L_9250, L_9251, L_9252, L_9253, L_9254, L_9255, L_9256, L_9257, L_9258, L_9259, L_926, L_9260, L_9261, L_9262, L_9263, L_9264, L_9265, L_9266, L_9267, L_9268, L_9297, L_9298, L_9299, L_93, L_930, L_9300, L_9301, L_9302, L_9303, L_9304, L_9305, L_9306, L_9307, L_9308, L_9309, L_931, L_9310, L_9311, L_9312, L_9313, L_9314, L_9315, L_9316, L_9317, L_9318, L_932, L_9320, L_9321, L_9322, L_9323, L_9324, L_9325, L_9326, L_9327, L_9328, L_9329, L_933, L_9330, L_9331, L_9332, L_9333, L_9334, L_9335, L_9336, L_9337, L_9338, L_9339, L_934, L_9340, L_9341, L_9342, L_9343, L_9344, L_9345, L_9346, L_9347, L_9348, L_9349, L_935, L_9350, L_9351, L_9352, L_9353, L_9354, L_9355, L_14252, L_14253, L_14254, L_14255, L_14256, L_14257, L_14268, L_14269, L_14270, L_14271, L_14272, L_14274, L_14275, L_14276, L_14277, L_14278, L_14279, L_14280, L_14281, L_14282, L_14283, L_14284, L_14285, L_14286, L_14287, L_14288, L_14289, L_14290, L_14291, L_14292, L_14293, L_14294, L_14295, L_14296, L_14297, L_17140, L_17141, L_17142, L_17143, L_17144, L_17145, L_17146, L_17147, L_17149, L_17150, L_17151, L_17152, L_17153, L_17154, L_17155, L_17156, L_17157, L_17158, L_17159, L_17160, L_17161, L_17162, L_17163, L_17164, L_17165, L_17166, L_17167, L_17168, L_17169, L_17170, L_17171, L_17172, L_17173, L_17174",toscano grande 2016,Toscano-grande 2016

This has allowed the development of a readily applicable bed numbering scheme and detailed faunal (macrofossil, foraminifera and ostracod) range charts. The Barremian-Aptian boundary is marked by the appearance of abundant examples of the ammonite Prodeshayesites and a marked lithological change from black shale to sandy mudstone. Higher parts of the Aptian have yielded abundant faunas, including ammonites of the fissicostatus, forbesi and deshayesi zones; the base of the forbesi Zone marked by the incoming of Ewaldi Marl facies. Poorly fossiliferous silty shales of the Albian tardefurcata Zone are succeeded by a bed with glauconite and phosphate pebbles, interpreted as marking the base of the mammillatum Superzone. This is overlain by fossiliferous clays of the Lower Albian and part of the Middle Albian. Range charts for macrofossils and microfossils from the Upper Barremian to Middle Albian of Speeton are constructed and biozones indicated. Aptian and Lower Albian successions inland of Speeton are highly variable, probably due to intra mid-Cretaceous fault movements.

[in Japanese with English abstract]",Bulletin of the Saitama Museum of Natural History,,"Ten teeth of the lamnoid shark, Carcharodon, from Chichibu Basin are reported here. Nine of them are from the Middle Miocene and one from the Early Miocene. The specimen from the Early Miocene is an upper jaw tooth of young Carcharodon megalodon. It has a well developed tooth neck between the crown and root. The shape and the serration of the crown resemble those of adult teeth of Carcharodon carcharias.This specimen might indicate that C. carcharias was derived from a common ancestor for C. angustidens by a neotenic process. Also from a Miocene bed in Chichibu Basin, five large vertebrae of a lamnoid shark were found. These vertebrae probably belong to C. megalodon. On the basis of growth rings, the shark with these fossil vertebrae are considered to be about six years old at the time of death. These fossil vertebrae are much larger than vertebrae of a Recent specimen of C. carcharias, which is 471 cm in total length, and similar in its age with the fossil specimen. This indicates that specimens of C. megalodon grew much faster than Recent specimens of C. carcharias.

However, in Mesozoic sedimentary sequences, diagenetic alteration often overprints the original skeletal carbonate isotope values. Yet, even if carbonate diagenesis did occur in such sequences, the original oxygen isotope values can still be preserved in enamel or bone phosphate of vertebrate fossils. Here are analysed the isotope compositions of tooth enamel structural carbonate and phosphate of various late Maastrichtian and early Palaeocene shark and ray taxa, as well as carapace bone of a late Maastrichtian marine turtle, Allopleuron hofmanni, from the type area of the Maastrichtian Stage in the southeast Netherlands and northeast Belgium. No correlation is observed between delta O-18 and delta O-18(p), suggesting diagenetic alteration of at least one fraction. In comparison to modern shark teeth, oxygen isotope ratios of the Maastrichtian-Palaeocene structural carbonate (delta O-18) are significantly lower (5 parts per thousand). As expected from previous isotope studies of calcitic fossils from the Maastrichtian type area, we believe the delta O-18 values to have been altered by meteoric diagenesis. The oxygen isotope ratios of phosphate (delta O-18(p)) in Maastrichtian-Palaeocene shark and ray teeth are relatively wide ranging (16.9 parts per thousand to 25.0 parts per thousand vs. VSMOW), with median values matching data for extant shark teeth delta O-18(p), suggesting retention of the in vivo delta O-18(p) signal. Similarly, the delta O-18 in the cheloniid turtle A. hofmanni is apparently overprinted by meteoric diagenesis, while the cortical (compact) bone of the carapace is interpreted to reflect the in vivo delta O-18(p) isotope composition. Using a phosphate-water fractionation equation for biogenic apatite and median isotope values of late Maastrichtian-early Palaeocene shark and ray teeth, a seawater temperature of 19.7 degrees C is calculated. This is in good agreement with temperatures expected for the Maastrichtian of this area Carbon isotope analyses (delta C-13) of structural carbonate in shark teeth have yielded isotope ratios that agree well with those of modern subtropical sharks, suggesting the in vivo carbon isotope signal to have been retained. A comparison of A. hofmanni bone carbonate delta C-13 values with those of extant marine turtle species, suggests A. hofmanni to have had a carnivorous lifestyle. Also, A. hofmanni shows delta C-13 values that are >10 parts per thousand lower than the average delta C-13 of sharks and rays, more similar to sympatric mosasaurs. This distribution is interpreted to be the effect of respiratory physiology on delta C-13 fractionation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To address the influence of the Alpine uplift on climate and oceanography of the northern Alpine molasse basin, a combined O-, Sr-, and Nd-isotope study was undertaken on fossil teeth from sharks (Synodontaspis sp., Galeocerdo cf. aduncus, Chaenogaleus sp.), and button-like teeth from the bony fish of the Upper Marine Molasse (Chrysophrys molassica). Average 18O values for hydroxyapatite of teeth from two sites are 20.3‚Ä∞ .1 D 0:6/ and 21.2‚Ä∞ .1 D 0:5/, while their average 87Sr=86Sr and 143Nd=144Nd ratios are 0.70850 ( 0.00001, 2 ) and 0.70882 ( 0.00003, 2 ), and 0.51220, and 0.51223 (both at 0.00001, 2 ), respectively. By comparison to the Sr-evolution curve for the global ocean, the Sr-isotope compositions suggest ages of about 22 and 17 Ma for the teeth. These ages are in good agreement with the depositional ages, which suggests open marine conditions. Open marine conditions are also compatible with (1) lower average 18O values and 87Sr=86Sr ratios for the one site compared to higher 18O values and higher 87Sr=86Sr ratios for the other site, (2) estimates for seawater temperatures which are similar to other estimates from deposits of similar latitude and age, (3) a comparison of seawater temperatures with average ambient air temperature estimates deduced from continental palaeoclimate indicators. Nd-isotope compositions are compatible with an influence of the North Atlantic on the Paratethys. Assuming constant salinity and seawater oxygen isotope composition, a 4¬∫C cooling can be inferred from average 18O values of the teeth between 22 and 17 Ma. This is similar to trends observed for foraminiferal records from the Mediterranean Tethys, but different from foraminiferal and molluscan records of the North Atlantic and the North Sea during this period, and allows for the possibility that the Alpine orogeny had an influence on the regional, circum-Alpine climate.

There are simple works of ancient pioneers in this field, but an author who hit a strong push was Federico Gómez-Llueca at the beginning of 20th century, studying the teeth of fish of the upper Miocene of Muro (Mallorca). Some years ago, Joan Bauzà dedicated a lot of effort to the study and collection of the Majorcan fossil fish, becoming a specialist with more that 50 papers published. A revision of the data bases of the fossil elasmobranches of Menorca and of Mallorca has been preserved in scientific collections of Menorca and Mallorca. In Menorca the data come from two private collections (Josep Quintana and Fernando Escalante collections) and other one of collection of the Museu Diocesà de Menorca (Ciutadella de Menorca). In Mallorca the material comes from collections deposited in two scientific societies: the Society of Natural History of the Balearics (SHNB, Palma de Mallorca), and the Balearic Museum of Natural Sciences (MBCN, Sóller). We have elaborated this work with the following methodology: consulting the data bases of the SHNB and the MBCN, revision of material in collections and bibliographical research. Some fossils yet it was not to included on the data base, for which data has been used for introducing new registers into the basis, as the case of the fossil elasmobranches of the collection Andreu Muntaner of the SHNB.

The stratigraphic distribution of teeth within the cliffs has not yet been documented. We utilized museum collections of in situ teeth to access their distribution within stratigraphic beds and a large selection of float teeth retrieved from Calvert County beaches as a proxy for the distribution of teeth within stratigraphic beds and across underlying beaches. Museum collections provide 1,866 teeth recorded in situ; float collections yield a total of 24,409 teeth. These data sets offer different, but complementary, results.
Miocene sediments along Calvert Cliffs comprise the Calvert, Choptank, and St. Marys formations. Over 96% of all teeth in the in situ data set derive from the Calvert Formation, likely due to favorable paleoenvironmental conditions for sharks. The non-uniform stratigraphic distribution of teeth is further supported by an uneven distribution of teeth collected on beaches below the cliffs. Samples from northern localities contained more float specimens; cliffs in this area are composed almost entirely of the Calvert Formation.
Fifteen genera are represented in the in situ and float collections. The main constituents are Carcharhinus spp., Hemipristis serra, Galeocerdo spp., Isurus spp., and Carcharias spp. Most of these genera exhibit significant unidirectional trends in the proportional abundance of teeth across Calvert Cliffs beaches. Factors influencing these variations remain unclear, but the overall dominance of carcharhiniforms over lamniform and other sharks observed for the Miocene persists in modern nearshore environments.",Visaggi,"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 30 (1): 26-35",Journal article,English,L,"L_806, L_807, L_808, L_809, L_810, L_811, L_812, L_813, L_814, L_815, L_816, L_817, L_818, L_819, L_820, L_821","L_8793, L_879, L_8790, L_8791, L_8792, L_8794, L_8795, L_8796, L_8797, L_8798, L_8799, L_88, L_880, L_8800, L_8801, L_8802, L_8803, L_8804, L_8805, L_8806, L_8807, L_8808, L_8809, L_881, L_8810, L_8811, L_8812, L_8813, L_8814, L_8815, L_8816, L_8817, L_8818, L_8819, L_882, L_8820, L_8821, L_8822, L_8823, L_8824, L_8825, L_8826, L_8843, L_8844, L_8845, L_8846, L_8847, L_8848, L_8849, L_885, L_8850, L_8851, L_8852, L_8853, L_8854, L_8855, L_8856, L_8857, L_8858, L_8859, L_886, L_8860, L_8861, L_8862, L_8863, L_8864, L_8865, L_8866, L_8867, L_8868, L_8869, L_887, L_8870, L_8871, L_8872, L_8873, L_8874, L_8875, L_8876, L_8877, L_8878, L_8879, L_888, L_8880, L_8881, L_8882, L_8883, L_8884, L_8885, L_8886, L_8887, L_8888, L_8889, L_889, L_8890, L_8891, L_8892, L_8893, L_8894, L_8895, L_8896, L_8897, L_8898, L_8899, L_89, L_890, L_8900, L_8901, L_8902, L_8903, L_8904, L_8905, L_8906, L_8907, L_8908, L_8909, L_891, L_8910, L_8911, L_8912, L_8913, L_8914, L_8915, L_8916, L_8917, L_8918, L_8919, L_892, L_8920, L_8921, L_8922, L_8923, L_8924, L_8925, L_8926, L_8927, L_8928, L_8934, L_8935, L_8936, L_8937, L_8938, L_8939, L_894, L_8940, L_8941, L_8942, L_8943, L_8944, L_8945, L_8946, L_8947, L_8948, L_8949, L_895, L_8950, L_8951, L_8952, L_8953, L_8954, L_8955, L_8956, L_8957, L_8958, L_8959, L_896",visaggi & godfrey 2010,Visaggi & Godfrey 2010

"Vullo, R.",2005,a,"Vertebrates from the Late Cretaceous of Charentes (SW France): biodiversity, taphonomy, palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography.",University of Rennes,,"Several Cenomanian vertebrate localities from the Charentes region (France), mostly new, have been studied. More than 18.000 remains, representing about 80 taxa, have been collected from 15 levels with different facies. Richest localities are Early Cenomanian in age and have yielded diversified microremain assemblages (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals). Although they are dominated by selachian remains (including 3 new genera and 4 new species), continental vertebrate elements are numerous. Some groups, like mammals, are found for the first time in the Cenomanian of Europe. Taphonomic analysis allows to distinguish several types of assemblages characterized by the size (millimetric to centimetric) and the abrasion of the elements. In a global sea-level rise context, the genesis processes of these vertebrate-bearing deposits (condensation, timeaveraging, brief events…) and the ecology of faunas (extinctions and faunal changes) are discussed. About the biogeography, an unusual mixture of Laurasiatic (e.g., Solemydidae, Troodontidae, Nodosauridae) and Gondwanan (e.g., Distobatidae, Ziphosuchia, Carcharodontosauridae) taxa is observed and explained by vicariance as well as dispersal. Crossing of the Tethys may have occur during the Early Cenomanian. The occurrence of both relictual and precursor taxa illustrates the faunal change that happened during the mid- Cretaceous. Lastly, selachians from the type Campanian area are described, including two new species. This study makes possible comparisons with faunas previously known from this stage.

The fauna consists of both marine and continental forms, including chimaeroids, various selachians and actinopterygians, chelonians, crocodilians, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, sauropod dinosaurs, and marine squamates. This mixed assemblage of autochthonous (coastal) and allochthonous (continental) elements comes mainly from a transgressive lag occurring near the base of the formation. It also contains some remains which are probably reworked from older middle Cenomanian deposits. Palaeontological, taphonomic, and sedimentologic data indicate a shallow platform and marine lagoon, with addition of some continental elements. A comparison with the late Cenomanian vertebrate assemblage of Charentes (southwestern France) shows numerous similarities between both areas. Some taxa, only known from Asturias and Charentes (e.g., the aigialosaur Carentonosaurus), suggest that the opening Bay of Biscay may have constituted a palaeobiogeographic area characterized by endemism during the mid-Cretaceous.

Each locality has yielded only a very few specimens and the diversity is therefore very low. However, some taxa are recorded for the first time in Africa. The Ashaka locality in the Upper Benue Trough (northeastern Nigeria) has yielded a small but interesting late Cenomanian assemblage of microremains, including teeth of “Carcharias” amonensis, Rhombopterygia zaborskii sp. nov., Hamrabatis sp., “Stephanodus” sp., and a possible ionoscopiform. A large prearticular dentition coming from the early Turonian beds of this locality is assigned to the large pycnodontiform Acrotemnus, a poorly known genus here regarded as a senior synonym of Macropycnodon. In the Lower Benue Trough (southeastern Nigeria), several localities ranging in age from the late Cenomanian to the early Maastrichtian have yielded various widespread taxa such as Ptychodus,Scapanorhynchus, Squalicorax, Vidalamiinae indet., cf. Protosphyraena, and Eodiaphyodus. The seaway that occupied the Benue Trough during transgressive episodes (late Cenomanian–early Turonian and Maastrichtian) created opportunities for the dispersal of many marine fish taxa into new areas, such as the proto-South Atlantic.

These two similar-sized taxa developed an analogous pavement-like grinding dentition, characterized by massive teeth with a rhomboidal to hexagonal occlusal surface.Although both genera appear to have been euryhaline forms, the hybodont Tribodus occurred in fresh/brackish water habitats (e.g. deltas) to shallow marine lagoons, whereas the ray Pseudohypolophus lived in brackish water to coastal marine environments. Palaeobiogeographically, their global distribution displays two distinct but adjoined areas, with Tribodus being present in the northern part of Gondwana (Brazil and NorthAfrica), and Pseudohypolophus occurring on both sides of the NorthAtlantic (NorthAmerica andWestern Europe). However, the two genera coexisted during Cenomanian times within a small overlap zone, localized in western France. A trophic competition may have arisen from this situation between these two selachians belonging to the same trophic guild. This peculiar situation is well documented within the Cenomanian transgressive series of Charentes (SWFrance), where a turnover between the two forms is observed (replacement of Tribodus by Pseudohypolophus).

"Wallett, L.A.",2006,,"Eocene selachian fauna from nearshore marine deposits, Ampazony, Northwestern Madagascar.",Mount Holyoke College,,"A new fossil-bearing locality near the northwestern Malagasy town of Ampazony yielded fossils of several selachian genera during the summer field seasons of 2001 and 2003. The sedimentology of the site and the temporal range of selachians recovered suggest that this site is Eocene in age. This designation places the locality within a large gap in Madagascar’s Cenozoic fossil record. Extremely few studies have previously been done in this area of Malagasy paleontology, making each new contribution particularly significant. Identification of the Ampazony collection indicates the presence of rays of the family Rhinopteridae and a variety of sharks. These include a species of Carcharhinus, Galeocerdo latidens, and Rhizoprionodon terraenove. This study explored the identification and distribution of Madagascar’s Eocene sharksand rays, with particular emphasis on their tooth size, shape, and abundance. The resulting fauna was then compared to selachian distributions throughout the Indian Ocean basin and in other biogeographically significant zones during the Paleocene and Eocene.

As a gateway to the Tethys, lithology, fauna and integrated stratigraphy (litho-, bio-, event, sequence, stable isotope stratigraphy) of the Upper Turonian succession in the U ́ pohlavy working quarry are described. Due to a large hiatus, the d13C curve cannot be used for stratigraphic purposes at the base of the section. Up-section, the curve exhibits the well-known middle Upper Turonian positive excursion. Biostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic subdivisions permit good correlation with other European Cretaceous basins. The inoceramid bivalve assemblage enables correlation with the US Western Interior. Palaeoceanographically, a positive peak in the d18O curve above the hiatus indicates the upper part of the Late Turonian cooling event observed in other areas. The cooling was accompanied by a southward shift of a cool/temperate oceanic biosedimentary system, expressed by the sudden turnover from siliciclastic towards pelagic carbonate deposition. It is associated with the establishment of presumed oligotrophic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the West Sudetic Island, as indicated by the sudden decrease of macrofaunal abundance and diversity.",Weise,"Cretaceous Research, 25: 329-352",Journal article,English,L,L_2215,"L_29382, L_29383, L_29384, L_29385, L_29386, L_29387, L_29388, L_29389, L_2939, L_29390, L_29391, L_29392, L_29393, L_29394, L_29395, L_29396",weise et al. 2004,Weise et al. 2004

"Williams, S.C.",2006,,Late Cretaceous selachian biostratigraphy in New Mexico.,University of New Mexico,,"New Mexico has an extensive fossil record of Late Cretaceous sharks that provides a basis for understanding their biostratigraphy, evolution and paleoecology. Seven biostratigraphically distinctive assemblages of selachians can be recognized for the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway in New Mexico: 1) middle Cenomanian-middle Turonian Ptychodus anonymus zone; 2) middle Turonian Ptychodus anonymus-Ptychodus whipplei zone; 3) middle Turonian-middle Coniacian Ptychodus whippleiSqualicorax falcatus zone; 4) middle Coniacian Ptychodus mortoni-Squalicoraxfalcatus zone; 5) middle Coniacian-late Santonian Ptychodus mortoni-Squalicorax kaupi zone; 6) early Campanian-middle Campanian Squalicorax kaupi- Squalicorax pristodontus; zone and 7) middle-late Campanian Squalicorax pristodontus-Cretodus zone. The primary species that define these zones belong to the genera Ptychodus and Squalicorax because they have the most complete fossil record of the selachian species found in the New Mexican Upper cretaceous. Each Ptychodus species has an average species duration of 4.1 million years, whereas Squalicorax species have an average duration of 11 million years. The evolutionary turnover of species of these genera correlate to marine regressions. There are three assemblages that are examined for paleoecology. The Middle Turonian Atarque Sandstone-Semilla Sandstone- Juana Lopez system provide a group of nearly time-correlative localities of both nearshore and offshore localities, and show that near shore localities are much more diverse and the fossils more abundant. The El Vado Sandstone provides a look at an unusually pelagic fauna where the assemblage is not dominated by one single species of grasping dention lamniform shark. The third assemblage is Dalton-Hosta system. This allows us to compare the effects of taphonomy on the abundances of species present.

"Williamson, T.E. & Lucas, S.G.",1993,,"Freshwater selachians from the early Palaeocene of the San Juan Basin, north-western Mexico, USA.",Tertiary Research,,"Screenwashing of bulk sediment from classic Puercan and Torrejonian fossil localities in the nonmarine Nacimiento Formation of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, has resulted in the recovery of two new species of stingray and a new species of Pucapristis?

The stingrays are referred to Dasyatis puercensis sp. nov. and Dasyatis? torrejonius sp. nov. D. puercensis occurs in Puercan age deposits of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and is also known from the early Palaeocene Tullock Formation of Montana.  D? torrejonius occurs in Puercan and Torrejonian deposits of the San Juan Basin and differs in having a markedly different ornamentation on the oral surface, usually having a medial-external depression and possessing prominent lateral angles.  A single tooth from a Puercan fossil locality is named Pucapristis? standhardtae sp. nov and is tentatively referred to the genus Pucapristis because it shows similarities to oral teeth that may have been incorrectly referred to the sclerorhynchid sawfish Pucapristis from the Late Cretaceous or early Palaeocene of Bolivia.  However, the prospect remains that P? standhardtae may represent a new species of orectoloboid shark, possibly referable to the genus Chiloscyllium.

This is the second reported occurrence of Palaeocene stingrays from freshwater deposits of North America and the first from rocks of Torrejonian age.  If the single tooth is correctly referred to Pucapristis, then it is the second reported occurrence of this genus and the first from Palaeocene freshwater deposits of North America.

The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary marks an abrupt and significant faunal turnover in freshwater selachians.  Most, if not all, Late Cretaceous, freshwater selachian taxa are replaced by Dasyatis, and closely related genera which become abundant in freshwater deposits of North and South America, Europe, and Africa and undergo rapid diversification during the early Cenozoic.",Williamson,"Tertiary Research, 14 (3): 97–105, 1 fig., 2 pl.",Journal article,English,L,,"L_14112, L_14113, L_14117, L_14134",williamson & lucas 1993,Williamson & Lucas 1993

We analyzed the age and growth using 117 fossilized centra (74 hemisectioned) from the Oldman and Dinosaur Park formations of southern Alberta. The resulting estimated maximum age was 16 years. Radial distance (RD) at the estimated asymptotic growth was calculated, and average RD at birth and 3 years were compared with two extant marine species of Rhinobatos (R. productus and R. rhinobatos). Birth ring size ranged from 0.9 to 1.8 mm RD. At age three, centrum RD was between 2.8 and 4.6 mm RD for M. bipartitus and significantly less than R. productus and R. rhinobatos (5.0–6.6 mm RD).

They provide large, relatively stable calcareous surfaces in systems where sedimentation is minimal. Diverse sclerobiont communities have inhabited reworked concretions since the Ordovician, so they have been important contributors to our understanding of the evolution of these ecological systems. Here, we describe reworked concretions from southern Israel where they are critical for interpreting the stratigraphy and paleoenvironment of an Upper Cretaceous sedimentary sequence. These cobble-sized concretions (averaging roughly 1,000 cm(3)) are found at the base of the Menuha Formation (Santonian to lower Campanian, Mount Scopus Group) unconformably above the top of the Zihor Formation (Turonian-Coniacian, Judea Group) exposed in the Ramon region of the Negev Highlands. The concretions are almost entirely composed of micritic limestone, and many are exhumed, cemented burrow-fills apparently from 10-20 m of upper Zihor Formation strata removed by erosion. There are also a few cobbles of dolomitic limestone and rare vertebrate bone. The cobbles are moderately to heavily bored by bivalves (producing Gastrochaenolites) and worms (forming Trypanites), and a few have cemented oysters. They are densely arrayed in a single layer, often touching each other or only a few centimeters apart. The sclerobionts associated with the cobbles, along with their hydrodynamic arrangement, strongly suggest that these cobbles accumulated in very shallow water above normal wave base. Most of them (77%) are encrusted on their top surfaces only, indicating that they were bored in place and not later delivered to a deeper environment by submarine currents. The rest of the Menuha Formation above is a chalk with relatively few macrofossils (primarily shark teeth and oysters) and a few trace fossils (Planolites and Thalassinoides are the most common). These reworked cobbles show that the initial deposits of the Menuha Formation accumulated in very shallow water. This has important implications for the development of the Syrian Arc structures in this region, especially the Ramon Monocline.",Wilson,"Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments, 92 (3): 343–352",Journal article,English,L,"L_2075, L_2076","L_28853, L_28855, L_28854, L_28856",wilson et al. 2012,Wilson et al. 2012

The fauna (42 taxa: 20 Neoselachii and 22 Teleostei) is characterized by a low diversity, but represents the species composition of the Lower Oligocene northsea very well with the gadidae as dominating element. For the „Leipziger Bucht"" the following taxa are introduced as new: Ciliata sp., Bregmaceros sp. (Teleostei). Plinthicus kruibekensis and a member of the Orectolobiformes (Neoselachii). Especially in the „Muschelsand"" appear some Perciformes which are new or not exactly described for the Rupelian of the Northsea.

New selachian paleofaunas from both formations are concentrated in stratigraphic intervals that also exhibit an abundance of mechanical tidal indicators and low-diversity marine ichnofossil assemblages (indicating brackish-water). Their presence in these two continental formations supports the reinterpretation of some sandy paleochannel deposits and shaly intervals as brackish-water estuaries, tidally influenced distributary channels, and interdistributary bays. Cederstroemia and Cretorectolobus are reported for the first time from Maastrichtian deposits (they previously have been documented only from Campanian and older strata). A new species of dasyatid is preserved in the middle Ferris Formation (earliest Paleocene: 64 Ma) and awaits fuller description. Prior interpretations of the Hanna Basin area as being far removed from the influences of the Western Interior Sea (WIS) during the latest Cretaceous and Paleocene must now be re-evaluated. New paleogeographic reconstructions of the western shoreline of the WIS, based in part on the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of selachian teeth in the Hanna Basin area, suggest that a complete marine regression and continental draining at the end of the Cretaceous did not occur.

Typically developed in the area of Opole Minor, it spreads across adjacent regions of Opole to cover an area of about 1300 km(2). The varied sedimentary structures and ubiquitous burrows, indicate their development as a stack of sand shoals or related bodies, up to a few tens of metres thick, some of which temporarily reached sea level. Amidst the shoals, storm scours intermittently formed channel-like infills, some with residual lags at the base. The reversed density stratification and/or an increasing gravity gradient involved mass movements, some of which may have been triggered by seismic shocks focused at the shore or the adjacent hinterland of Podolia and Volhynia. Special attention is paid to the diverse fossils, all taphonomically filtered (aragonite shells and chitinous carapaces being lost), but which locally are mass-aggregated. They typify particular sand sets/bodies, to form allochthonous assemblages, some members of which (the cirripedes Scalpellum and Creusia, the shark Hemipristis, the ray Myliobatis) are newly recognized in the Ukrainian part of the Fore-Carpathian Basin. The others enrich considerably the faunal content of the Middle Miocene (Badenian) Paratethyan basins, either in terms of taxonomic diversity, or the eco-taphonomy of selected taxa (the starfish Astropecten, diverse echinoids). The whole faunal content of the Mykolaiv Sands may owe its profuse development to the global Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum of early Badenian age.",Wysocka,"Geological Quarterly, 56 (3): 475-492",Journal article,English,L,"L_3266, L_3267, L_828, L_829","L_6407, L_6408, L_8996, L_8997, L_8998, L_8999, L_9, L_90, L_900",wysocka et al. 2012,Wysocka et al. 2012

The magnitude of the 18O decrease indicates a depletion in 18O of surface waters by 2-3‰ relative to Eocene mean ocean water. This value is lower than that of coeval lakes reconstructed from freshwater gastropod 18O values from the Paris Basin, suggesting that large rivers with high-latitude catchment areas drained into the North Sea.

Four stratigraphic sections are measured, described and sampled in the field at Hussein Wally Village, Birket Qarun, Qasr el-Sagha and Wadi elAfreet. Lithostratigraphically, the studied succession is divided into three formations arranged from ba se to top into Gehannam, Birket Qarun and Qasr el-Sagha formations. This Eocene sequence provides by far the most complete view of the endemic African vertebrate fauna. Identification of the basic pattern of fish remains and taxonomic evaluation revealed that the recorded shark and rays taxa belong to 3 classes, 7 orders, 12 families, 18 genera, and 21 species. The identified taxa are macro-scale, collected on the surface, and known either from teeth or rostral remains. A taxonomic account and detailed morphologic description of the fossils shark, rays and bony fish teeth have been achieved. The depositional environments in the studied Middle-Late Eocene age sequence are interpreted. The abundance of recognized vertebrate fauna indicates environments varying from open marine shelf with low energy conditions to restricted marine shallow water conditions. However, the frequent distribution of macrofauna with intense bioturbation in sandstones of Birket Qarun Formation is a good indicator of restricted shallow water conditions.",Zalat,"Delta Journal of Science, 38: 202 -217",Journal article,English,L,L_1191,"L_11968, L_11969, L_1197, L_11970, L_11971, L_11972, L_11973, L_11974, L_11975, L_11976, L_11977, L_11978, L_11979, L_1198, L_11980, L_11981, L_11982, L_11983, L_11984",zalat et al. 2017,Zalat et al. 2017

"Zalmout, I.S. & Mustafa, H.A.",2001,,A selachian fauna from the Late Cretaceous of Jordan.,Abhath Al–Yamouk Basic Sciences and Engineering,,"Fish remains belonging to seventeen selachian species of which one is new are described in the present paper from late Cretaceous, the Amman Formation of Jordan. The fauna include the species: Carcharias khderii nov. sp., Scapanorhynchus texanus, Cretolamna appendiculata, C. biauriculata, Serratolamna serrata, Cretoxyrhina mantelli, Squalicorax kaupi. S. bassanii, S. pristodontus, S. africanus, Rhinobatos sp., Parapalaeobates atlanticus, Parapalaeobates sp.. Dalpiazia stromeri, Ptychotrygon triangularis, Ptychotrygon sp., and Rhombodus binkhorsti. Based on the context of this fauna, the age of the Amman Formation extends from the late Santonian to early Maastrichtian. The coexistence of Cretoxyrhina mantelli and Squalicorax kaupi in the same biozone demonstrates a late Santonian age for (he lower part of the Amman Formation, while the upper part of this formation is of an early Maastrichtian age due to the coexistence of 5. africanus and Cretolamna biauriculata which previously are known only from the early Maastrichtian. Serratolamna serrata is of great interest since this is the oldest record (early Maastichtian) of this species. Squalicorax kaupi, S. bassanii, S pristodontus, and 5. africanus, which are morphologically similar, probably belong to the same trophic level, and inhabited the same environment. Unlike Squalicorax africanus which is endemic to Egypt, Morocco and Jordan, species described in this study are distributed worldwide giving them a strong cosmopolitan character.",Zalmout,"Abhath Al–Yamouk Basic Sciences and Engineering, 10 (2b): 374–434, 3 fig., pl. 1–9",Journal article,English,L,"L_2207, L_2208, L_2209, L_2210, L_2211, L_2212","L_29347, L_29348, L_29349, L_2935, L_29350, L_29351, L_29352, L_29353, L_29354, L_29355, L_29358, L_29359, L_2936, L_29360, L_29361, L_29362, L_29363, L_29364, L_29365, L_29366, L_29367, L_29368, L_29369, L_2937, L_29370, L_29371, L_29372, L_29373, L_29374",zalmout & mustafa 2001,Zalmout & Mustafa 2001
